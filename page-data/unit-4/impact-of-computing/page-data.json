Students will explore both the beneficial and harmful effects of computing innovations and examine if those consequences are intended or unintended. Students learn about crowdsourcing and how it affects the development of a solution. They will also explore the impacts of the digital divide, computing bias, and bias in artificial intelligence on individuals and communities. They will also learn about open source software and evaluate the use of computing based on legal and ethical concerns. Students will also learn about safe computing practices, including cryptography and authentication, and examine privacy concerns with our ever connected world.
