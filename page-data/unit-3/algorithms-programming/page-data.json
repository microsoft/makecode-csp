Students will learn the three types of algorithm implementations: sequencing, selection, and iteration. Students will develop an understanding of programming concepts such as algorithms, program flow, events, variables (sprites, integers, strings, and Booleans), conditional statements, randomness, loops, projectiles, and text-based programming. Students will apply computational thinking practices (i.e. iterative design, debugging) to their work throughout the unit. Students will also explore practice tracking the path of a robot according to an algorithm and practice code tracing that utilizes sequencing, selection, and iteration.
