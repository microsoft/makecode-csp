(\", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"AAP-1\"), \") Additionally, students learn that the way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values. (AAP-2) Students also learn how programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.

(\", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"CRD-1\"), \"). Finally, as they work through the design processing creating their project, students learn how developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.
