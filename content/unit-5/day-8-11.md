## Overview

On Days 8-11, students will demonstrate their understanding of algorithm implementations by creating a program that includes (1) functions and parameters, (2) return values, (3) Boolean statements (selection), and (4) logic in loops (iteration). Students are tasked with creating a program that seeks user input, includes a visible output, and uses extensions. Students will work in pairs to create their program, receiving feedback from others throughout the process.

Days 8-11 will be about:

* Practice GitHub workflow habits- push, pull, commit, comment.
* Collaborate on a project.
* Apply programming concepts.
