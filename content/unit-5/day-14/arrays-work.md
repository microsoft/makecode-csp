## Reflection/Homework 

1. What is the difference between creating an array of numbers and storing multiple values as individual variables (as in, value1 = 1, value2 = 2, value3 ...)?

2. What can an array do that storing different variables by themselves cannot?

3. How does the length of an array relate to the position of the final element?
