## Overview

On Days 20-27, students will demonstrate their understanding of algorithm implementations by creating a program that includes (1) functions and parameters, (2) return values, (3) Boolean statements (selection), (4) logic in loops (iteration), (5) multiplayer interface, (6) scene design using Tile maps, and (7) lists (arrays). Students are tasked with creating a program that seeks user input, includes a visible output, and uses extensions. Students will work in small groups to create their program, receiving feedback from others throughout the process.

Days 20-27 will be about:

* Collaborating on a project using GitHub workflow habits - push, pull, commit, comment.
* Applying programming concepts.
