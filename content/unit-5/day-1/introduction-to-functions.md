## Reflection/Homework

Describe how using functions in code can help make programming easier.
Does putting code into separate functions always make sense?
Would it be more or less clear if we took the code from our example (placeHuman, placeCow, and placeAsteroid) and made a function that calls the other three, so that our on start block only had a single block inside of it?
