## Overview

On Day 13, students will learn about using tile maps in their games. Students will learn that maps and levels form the basis of many of the most common types of video games; they allow a canvas for the games story to progress, and for the player to explore. They will then learn how to find tile maps as a library in extensions and how to create tile maps. Students will also learn how to create an image with a tile and will practice creating both tile maps and images for tiles.

Day 13 will be about:

* Introduction to Tile maps
* Creating Tile Maps
* Creating images for Tiles
* Editing Tile maps
