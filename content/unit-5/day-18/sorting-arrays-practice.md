## Sorting Arrays

Write your pseudocode for each sorting algorithm here:

**Bubble sort**: 

**Selection sort**: 

**Insertion sort**:

### Tasks


#### Bubble sorting algorithm

1. Implement the Bubble Sorting algorithm in MakeCode. 
2. Use our pseudocode as a start. 
3. Create a flowchart to visualize the steps. 
4. Remember to comment your code as you develop your project. 

## Reflection/Homework 

These questions are to be answered on the second day of this lesson:

1. Why are sorting algorithms important?  

2. What concepts did you use to code your sorting algorithm?  

3. What was most challenging?  

4. What surprised you most?
