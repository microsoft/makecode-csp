## Overview

On Day 6, students will be reminded of the concepts they learned in Unit 3 regarding Boolean values and logical expressions. Students will learn that logical expressions can be used for more than evaluating numerical expressions or yes/no, true/false questions. Logic can also be used to evaluate user input, which adds interactivity and enhances gameplay. Students will practice what they have learned by creating code segments that seek user input.

Day 6 will be about: 

* Logical expression refreshers.
* Introducing user interaction.
* Exploring logical expressions and user input.
