## Overview

On Day 1, we will begin to explore the power of using functions in our code. Students will learn that functions allow programmers to group sections of code to be run together. Students will see that when functions are used in programs, they improve a code's readability and allow common actions to be reused. Additionally, pattern recognition and efficiency will be practiced and reinforced.

Day 1 will be about:

* Introduction to Functions
* Creating Functions
* Using Functions in Events
* Extension: Code in JavaScript
