## Activity

Go to [Activity: Logic in Loops](https://arcade.makecode.com/courses/csintro2/logic/while).  Complete student tasks 1-2.

### Tasks

#### Task 1

1. Guessing Game Mod
2. Using the Generate a second random value between 1 and 5, stored in secondValue. 
3. Change splash to “Answer the question!”
4. Compare guess to the result of value + secondValue.
5. Change ask for string to ask for the sum of value and secondValue.
    * Include what those two values are in the message.
6. Comment your code.

#### Task 2

1. Review the code segment in Sample #2 and examine what the game is missing to work properly.
2. Code a single fireball to fire from mySprite in when A is pressed:
3. Use if  to check that the player has more than one life.
4. Create a projectile of a fireball from mySprite (w/vx & vy).
5. Decrease life by 1.
6. Increase score by 1.
7. Replace the if statement with a while loop, so that the projectiles continue until the player is out of life.

## Reflection/Homework 

1. How are While loops different from For loops?

2. Explain why picking up the fireSource allowed the player to keep making fireballs, without any other buttons being pressed.

3. **Challenge**: If "IF statements" didn’t exist, could you use While loops to implement the same behavior in blocks? If so, how?
