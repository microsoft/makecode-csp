## Requirements

**Your project must**:

:white_large_square: Implement that includes and executes:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Functions with parameters and return values<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp:white_large_square: Conditional Statements and Boolean Operators<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp:white_large_square: User input<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp:white_large_square: While Loops<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp:white_large_square: Arrays<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp:white_large_square: Multiplayer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp:white_large_square: Tile maps<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp:white_large_square: An extension (either an existing extension, or one you create)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp:white_large_square: Documentation â€“ a user guide to explain how it works

**When you create your program, you must test your program in at least two different ways. You will document those test cases here**:


### First test case 

Describe how you tested your program:

Describe what condition in your program was being tested:

Identify the result of the test case:


### Second test case 

Describe how you tested your program: 

Describe what condition in your program was being tested: 

Identify the result of the test case: 

## Responses

**When your program is complete, you must respond to the following prompts and include your responses in the chart provided:**

The purpose of my program is:

**Note**: Purpose is defined as the problem being solved or creative interest being pursued through the program.
<br/><br/>

The function of my program is:

**Note**: Program functionality is defined as the behavior of a program during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it.
<br/><br/>

The input of my program is:

The output of my program is:
<br/><br/>

Explain in detailed steps how the algorithms implemented in your program work. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it.
