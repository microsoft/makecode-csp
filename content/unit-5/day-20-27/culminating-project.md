    * You may consider assigning small groups. 
* Students should offer feedback: 
    * Which one sounds most interesting from a user's perspective? 
    * Any resources or ideas you have that would help? 
* Students will need to divide tasks among each other to begin the workflow for the project.

#### 4. Select your group and project idea (10 minutes)

### Day 23

#### 0. Before class

* Print enough Gallery Walk Feedback forms for each group to use one at each game they review. 

#### 1. Set up for Gallery Walk (5 minutes)

* Task students with setting up for the Gallery Walk.

        * Purpose of the program
        * Program's functionality

### 2. Gallery Walk (25 minutes)
