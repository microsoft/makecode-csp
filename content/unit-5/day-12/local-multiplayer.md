    * a. Write conditional statements. [2.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
    * b. Determine the result of conditional statements. [4.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
* AAP-3.E For generating random values:
    * a. Write expressions to generate possible values. 2.B
    * b. Evaluate expressions to determine the possible results. 4.B
* [CRD-2.C](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=42) Identify input(s) to a program. [3.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)

### Essential Knowledge

* [AAP-2.E.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=78) A Boolean value is either true or false.
* [AAP-2.E.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=78) The exam reference sheet provides the following relational operators: =, ≠, >, <, ≥, and ≤. Text and Block:<br/>
§ a = b<br/>
§ a ≠ b<br/>
§ a > b<br/>
§ a < b<br/>
§ a ≥ b<br/>
§ a ≤ b<br/>
These are used to test the relationship between two variables, expressions, or values. A comparison using a relational operator evaluates to a Boolean value. For example,  a = b evaluates to true if a and b are equal; otherwise, it evaluates  to false.

* [AAP-2.H.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=80) Conditional statements, or “if-statements,” affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression. 
* [AAP-2.H.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=80) The exam reference sheet provides
    * Text: IF(condition) { &lt;block of statements&gt; }
    * Block: IF condition block of statements in which the code in block of statements is executed if the Boolean expression condition evaluates to true; no action is taken if condition evaluates to false.
* AAP-3.E.1 The exam reference sheet provides RANDOM(a, b) Block: RANDOM  a, b which generates and returns a random integer from a to b, inclusive. Each result is equally likely to occur. For example, RANDOM(1, 3) could return 1, 2, or 3.
* [CRD-2.C.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=42) An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.
* [CRD-2.C.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=42) Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution.

## Details

### 1. Introduce multiplayer (10 minutes) 

* Define multiplayer
* Explain how multiplayer works
* Demonstrate setting 2 players

### 2. Activity: Multiplayer (40 minutes) 

* Direct students to go to their <a href="/unit-5/day-12/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> page.
* Direct students to complete Tasks 2 through 5.
* If students have time, encourage them to recreate code segments in JavaScript.

### 3. Reflection/Homework

* If you run out of time, you may also assign this as individual homework.
* Students should complete their reflection.
* How does having multiple players at once in a single game allow for new and compelling games?
* Were there any difficulties in implementing the multiplayer game? Was it easier or harder than a single player game?
* How might/did you debug multiplayer code?
