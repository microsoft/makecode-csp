## Overview

On Day 4, we will continue exploring the power of functions and reusing code. When writing code, software developers want to avoid spending time recreating code that already exists. We've experienced how a single developer might do this using functions, but not how developers can share code amongst others.

Day 4 will be about:

* The difference between pre-made and student-made functions.
* The purpose of extensions.
* Importing extensions.
* Writing extensions.
* Sharing extensions for other projects.
