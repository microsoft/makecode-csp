## Activity

### A. We worked on Task 1 together in class. Add the link to your project here

#### Task 1

Mod the Hungry Game:

1. When the A button is pressed, instead of setting the value of isHungry to True, set it to be the opposite of what it currently is. 
2. Add another Boolean variable “isBackgroundYellow” = true. 
3. Add same code to On A button pressed to toggle that value. 
4. Add another If...Then… Else statement to On Game Update to check the value of isBackgroundYellow and change the background color. 
5. Comment your code.

### B. You and a partner worked on Task 2 together in class. Add the link to your project here

#### Task 2 Section B

NOT Left is Right:

1. Create a sprite, move the sprite with buttons.
2. Make a variable named isLeft and set it to false.
3. In on game update, assign isLeft to a sprite’s x position < 80 comparison.
4. Use an If block to check if NOT(isLeft).
5. If so, make your Sprite say “Right!” for 200ms
6. Comment your code.

#### Task 3

Pizza or Burger:

1. Start a new project named pizzaBurger.
2. Create a sprite.
3. Create a new Boolean called pizza and set it to true.
4. Make pizza alternate values when the player presses B.

## Reflection/Homework

1. What is a Boolean flag? Describe a case in which you might you want to use one?

2. What is the difference between an and block and an or block?

* In what cases will they both evaluate to true?
* In what cases will they both evaluate to false?
* In what cases will they evaluate differently?
