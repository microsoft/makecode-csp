## Reflection 

1. What is a Boolean flag? Describe a case in which you might you want to use one? A Boolean flag is another term for a Boolean variable whose values are True/False. Boolean flags are used to set the state of your program. 

2. What is the difference between an AND operator and an OR operator?  

* In what cases will they both evaluate to true? When both values are True.
* In what cases will they both evaluate to false?  When both values are False.
* In what cases will they evaluate differently? When one value is True and the other False.
