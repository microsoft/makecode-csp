## Overview

On Day 3, students learn that functions can not only pass information, but can also give back values through the use of return values, allowing developers to save the value from the function for use elsewhere in the program. Students will examine some code segments together as a class to see how return values work. Then, students will work independently to create code segments that incorporate return values.

Day 3 will be about:

* Introduction of return values.
* Write functions with return values and parameters.
