## Reflection/Homework 

1. Aside from a Maze game, what types of different games could you create with Tile Maps?

Platformer style games like Mario Brothers, Racing games (with a top-down view), Adventure games 

2. What is the default size when you create a new Tile Map?

The default Tile Map size is 16 Tiles wide, by 16 Tiles high.  And each Tile is 16 x 16 pixels (the size of tiles can't change).  So, in pixels, the default size of a Tile Map is 256 pixels wide, by 256 pixels high.
