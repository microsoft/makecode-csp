### Learning Objectives 

* [CRD-2.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=41) Describe the purpose of a computing innovation. [1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=23)
* [AAP-1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Represent a value with a variable.â€‚[3.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=23)

### Essential Knowledge 

* [CRD-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=41) The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
* [CRD-2.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=41) An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation.
* [AAP-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values.

### 1. Introduce Tile maps (5 minutes)

* Define Tile maps.
* Explain how Tile maps will expand game play.

### 2. Learn how to create Tile maps (20 minutes) 

* Demonstrate how to create tile maps.
* Guide students to create a basic Maze game.
* When students complete the project, encourage them to go to Section A of the Introduction to Tile maps and add their links to the projects on the page.

### 3. Tile Maps practice (20 minutes)

* Go to Section B of the  Introduction to Tile maps page.
* Task students with completing the modding challenges.
* If students have time, encourage them to complete the Extension activities or use the Overworld extension in a project.

### 4. Reflection/Homework

_If you run out of time, you may also assign this as individual homework. Students should complete their reflection._

* Aside from a Maze game, what types of different games could you create with Tile Maps?
* What is the default size when you create a new Tile Map?
* Was there a tricky/challenging part in creating your Maze game?  What was it and how did you overcome it?
