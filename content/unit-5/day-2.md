## Overview

On Day 2, students will learn that functions not only help to keep code organized and efficient, but can also be generalized through the use of parameters, allowing code to be reused with a range of inputs and conditions. Students will learn how to create functions with a single parameter and with multiple parameters. Students will then apply what they learn to a series of tasks that require them to create a greeting function, a function with multiple parameters, and a function that incorporates horizontal movement.

Day 2 will be about:

* Procedures
* Parameters
* Arguments
* Procedure calls
* Writing functions with parameters
* Writing functions with multiple parameters
