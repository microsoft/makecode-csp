## Overview

Students will experience how information is organized in arrays through three different sorting algorithms in this unplugged activity. They will write pseudocode for each algorithm and build a simple sorting algorithm in MakeCode. Students will understand that algorithms can take the same input and produce the same output at different efficiencies.

Days 18 will cover:

* Unplugged: Sorting Arrays. 
* Develop algorithms/pseudocode for bubble, selection, and insertion sorts.
* Create a sorting algorithm in MakeCode.
