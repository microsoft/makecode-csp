## Summary

* [Day 4 PowerPoint deck]()
* [Football]() (for teacher)
* [My Extension]() (for teacher)
* <a href="/unit-5/day-4/making-using-extensions">Making and Using Extensions</a> handout
* [Making and Using Extensions]() handout in Word
* [Activity: Making and Using Extensions]()
* [Resource: Defining Blocks]()

### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments

1. Introduce Extensions (5 minutes)
2. Learn How to Create and Use Extensions (15 minutes)
3. Activity: Using extensions (30 minutes)
4. Reflection/Homework

### Learning Objectives 

* [AAP-3.A]() For procedure calls:
    * a. Write statements to call procedures. [3.B]()
    * b. Determine the result or effect of a procedure call. [4.B]()
* [AAP-3.B]() Explain how the use of procedural abstraction manages complexity in a program. [3.C]()
* [AAP-3.D]() Select appropriate libraries or existing code segments to use in creating new programs. [2.B]()

### Essential Knowledge

* [AAP-3.A.1]() A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values.
* [AAP-3.A.2]() Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programming language. 
* [AAP-3.A.4]() A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements, causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. Once the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow of control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called.
* [AAP-3.B.1]() One common type of abstraction is procedural abstraction, which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does, not how it does it.
* [AAP-3.B.2]() Procedural abstraction allows a solution to a large problem to be based on the solutions of smaller subproblems. This is accomplished by creating procedures to solve each of the subproblems.
* [AAP-3.B.4]() A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows or program code reuse, which helps manage complexity.
* [AAP-3.D.1]() A software library contains procedures that may be used in creating new programs.
* [AAP-3.D.2]() Existing code segments can come from internal or external sources, such as libraries or previously written code.
* [AAP-3.D.3]() The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs.
* AAP-3.D.4 Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used.
* AAP-3.D.5 Documentation for an API/library is necessary in understanding the behaviors provided by the API/library and how to use them.

## Details

### 1. Introduce extensions (5 minutes) 

* Explain the difference between a pre-made function and a student-made function.
* Remind students what procedural abstraction is.
* Define Extensions.
* Explain how extensions assist in writing code.

### 2. Learn how to use and create extensions (15 minutes)

* Demonstrate how to add extensions to projects.
* Guide students to learn how to:
    * Create a simple football game using the darts extension.
    * Use existing code segments in another project by adding them as an extension.

### 3. Activity: Writing functions with parameters (30 minutes)

* Direct students to their <a href="/unit-5/day-4/making-using-extensions">Making and Using Extensions</a> page.
* Task students with completing Tasks 1, 2a, and 2b.
* If students have time, encourage them to complete the extensions activities for both tasks (coding in JavaScript).

### 4. Reflection/Homework 

_If you run out of time, you may also assign this as individual homework. Students should complete their reflection._

1. How could sharing and importing projects help manage a group project with four or more students?
2. What is one benefit to importing code from a project versus just copying the code into the project? You might find it useful to discuss task #2 in your response to this question.
