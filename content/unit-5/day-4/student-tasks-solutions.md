## Reflection 

1. How could you use extensions to create a group project with four or more students?
    * Plan the game out first.
    * Split up the work of the game among the students - for example, one student is responsible for Setting the Scene for the game, one student is responsible for the opening or ending, etc.
    * Bring all the code together by publishing them as extensions and adding them to a new project. 
2. What is one benefit to using extensions as a way to reuse code from existing projects, versus just copying the code?
    * If the project has a lot of code, adding it as an extension helps "abstract" away all this code in the background and improve the readability of your program.
    * Easier testing - don't have to worry about accidentally messing up the extension code in your project.
    * Code reuse.
