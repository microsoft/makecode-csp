## Overview

On Day 7, students will learn that evaluation of conditions can occur on more than a single occasion/event. Students will learn that using a While loop (or REPEAT UNTIL) for conditions will continuously evaluate that condition until the condition is met, making checking for multiple conditions throughout game play possible. Students will practice using While loops in code segments.

* Day 7 will be about:
* Introducing Logic in Loops.
* If/then expressions vs. while loops.
