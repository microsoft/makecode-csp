## Activity

Go to [Activity: Parameters](https://arcade.makecode.com/courses/csintro3/functions/parameters).  Apply what you have learned regarding functions with parameters to complete student tasks 1-3. 

### Tasks

#### Task 1

1. Create a function named **greet**.
2. Add a parameter firstName that is of type **string**. 
3. In the function, **splash** a greeting that includes firstName (if “You” is passed, it might splash “Hey, You!”). 
4. Call the function with three different names.

#### Task 2

1. Start with your solution to task #1.
2. Modify the function so that it accepts two strings: firstName and lastName.
3. Make use of both parameters in the greeting (for example, greeting ("You", "Friend") could result in “Hey You Friend!”).

#### Task 3

1. Create a function named horizontalMovement. 
2. Add two parameters to the function: player of type Sprite, and left of type Boolean. 
3. if left is true, move player 10 pixels to the left. 
4. if left is false, move player 10 pixels to the right. 

#### Extension

Recreate the parameters tasks using JavaScript or Python.

#### Apply

Review your past projects for opportunities to use functions with parameters.

## Reflection

1. How do parameters allow for more flexible code?
2. Review the functions you have learned, like splash and say, and identify which ones have parameters.
3. Where might parameters be used in your previous projects?

## Homework

* Complete the problem set at [Problem Set: Parameters](https://arcade.makecode.com/courses/csintro3/functions/parameters-problems).
* You may use block or text-based programming for the problem sets.
* Comment your code as your work.
