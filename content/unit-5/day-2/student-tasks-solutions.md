## Tasks

### Task 1

1. Create a function named **greet**.
2. Add a parameter firstName that is of type **string**.
3. In the function, **splash** a greeting that includes firstName (if “You” is passed, it might splash “Hey, You!”).
4. Call the function with three different names.

### Task 2

1. Start with your solution to task #1.
2. Modify the function so that it accepts two strings: firstName and lastName.
3. Make use of both parameters in the greeting (for example, greeting ("You", "Friend") could result in “Hey You Friend!”).

### Extension:

Recreate the parameters tasks using JavaScript or Python.

### Apply

Review your past projects for opportunities to use functions with parameters.

## Reflection 

* How do parameters allow for more flexible code? 
* Review the functions you have learned, like splash and say, and identify which ones have parameters. 
* Where might parameters be used in your previous projects? 

### Homework

* Complete the problem set at [Problem Set: Parameters](https://arcade.makecode.com/courses/csintro3/functions/parameters-problems).
* You may use block or text-based programming for the problem sets.
* Comment your code as your work.
