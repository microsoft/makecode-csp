### Learning Objectives

* AAP-3.F For simulations:
    * a. Explain how computers can be used to represent real-world phenomena or outcomes.
    * b. Compare simulations with real-world contexts.
* [AAP-4.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=101) For determining the efficiency of an algorithm:
    * a. Explain the difference between algorithms that run in reasonable time and those that do not.
    * b. Identify situations where a heuristic solution may be more appropriate. 1.D
* [AAP-4.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=103) Explain the existence of undecidable problems in computer science. 1.A

### Essential Knowledge

* AAP-3.F.1 Simulations are abstractions of more complex objects or phenomena for a specific purpose. 
* AAP-3.F.2 A simulation is a representation that uses varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a phenomenon.
* AAP-3.F.3 Simulations often mimic real-world events with the purpose of drawing inferences, allowing investigation of a phenomenon without the constraints of the real world.
* AAP-3.F.4 The process of developing an abstract simulation involves removing specific details or simplifying functionality.
* AAP-3.F.5 Simulations can contain bias derived from the choices of real-world elements that were included or excluded. 
* AAP-3.F.6 Simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical for experiments (e.g., too big, too small, too fast, too slow, too expensive, and too dangerous).
* AAP-3.F.7 Simulations facilitate the formulation and refinement of hypotheses related to the objects or phenomena under consideration.
* AAP-3.F.8 Random number generators can be used to simulate the variability that exists in the real world. 
* AAP-4.A.1 A problem is a general description of a task that can (or cannot) be solved algorithmically. An instance of a problem also includes specific input. For example, sorting is a problem; sorting the list (2, 3, 1, 7) is an instance of the problem.
* AAP-4.A.2 A decision problem is a problem with a yes/no answer (e.g. is there a path from A to B?). An optimization problem is a problem with the goal of finding the "best" solution among many (e.g., what is the shortest part from A to B?)
* AAP-4.A.3 Efficiency is an estimation of the amount of computational resources used by an algorithm. Efficiency is typically expressed as a function of the size of the input. EXCLUSION STATEMENT (EK AAP-4.A.): Formal analysis of algorithms (Big-O) and formal reasoning using mathematical formulas are outside the scope of this course and the AP Exam. 
* AAP-4.A.4 An algorithm's efficiency is determined through formal or mathematical reasoning.
* AAP-4.A.5 An algorithm's efficiency can be informally measured by determining the number of times a statement or group of statements executes.
* AAP-A.4.6 Different correct algorithms for the same problem can have different efficiencies.
* AAP-4.A.7 Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or slower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) are said to run in a reasonable amount of time. Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies are examples of algorithms that run in an unreasonable amount of time.
* [AAP-4.A.8](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=102) Some problems cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time because there is no efficient algorithm for solving them. In these cases, approximate solutions are sought. 
* [AAP-4.A.9](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=102) A heuristic is an approach to a problem that produces a solution that is not guaranteed to be optimal but may be used when techniques that are guaranteed to always find an optimal solution are impractical. 
* [AAP-4.B.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=103) A decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct output for all inputs (e.g., “Is the number even?”).
* [AAP-4.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=103) An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes or-no answer.<br/>
X EXCLUSION STATEMENT (EK AAP-4.B.2): Determining whether a given problem is undecidable is outside the scope of this course and the AP Exam.
* [AAP-4.B.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=103) An undecidable problem may have some instances that have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem.

## DetaILS

### 1. Can Computers Solve Every Problem introduction (15 minutes)

* Discuss simulations and how have simulations helped in solving problems.
* Discuss the different types of problems solved algorithmically.
* Explain the concepts related to the efficiency of solving problems.
* Explain what Heuristic algorithms are.
* Distinguish between decidable vs. undecidable problems.

### 2. Jigsaw (35 minutes)

* Place students in groups of three.
* One person in each group will research:
    * Simulations
    * Heuristic algorithms
    * Undecidable problem
* Encourage students to add the summaries of their research on their group's <a href="/unit-5/day-28/computer-problem-solving">Computer Problem Solving</a> page.
* Each group member will share their finding with the class.

### 3. Reflection/Homework

_If you run out of time, you may also assign this as individual homework. Students should complete their reflection in their OneNote._

1. NYU has a course on heuristic problem solving. The professor's goal is to develop ominheurusts. What does that mean to you?
