## Requirements

Your project must include: 

:white_large_square: Functions with parameters and return values. 
:white_large_square: Conditional Statements and Boolean Operators ("Selection" programming construct).
:white_large_square: User Input.
:white_large_square: While Loops ("Iteration" programming construct).
:white_large_square: An extension (either an existing extension, or one you create).
:white_large_square: Documentation â€“ a user guide to explain how it works.

## Create Program

When you create your program, you must test your program in at least two different ways. You will document those test cases here:

### First test case 

Describe how you tested your program:
<br/><br/>

Describe what condition in your program was being tested: 
<br/><br/>

Identify the result of the test case: 
<br/><br/>

### Second test case 

Describe how you tested your program:
<br/><br/>

Describe what condition in your program was being tested: 
<br/><br/>

Identify the result of the test case: 
<br/><br/>

## Program Completed

When your program is complete, you must respond to the following prompts and include your responses in the chart provided:

The link to my project is: 

Screenshot of my code segment with labels of the required components:

* Function with parameters
* Function with return value
* Conditional Statement
* Boolean Operator
* Logic in Loops (While)

Screencast of my program running:

The purpose of my program is:
<br/>

**Note**: Purpose is defined at the problem being solved or creative interest being pursued through the program.

The function of my program is:
<br/>

**Note**: Program functionality is defined as the behavior of a program during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it.

The input of my program is:
<br/>

The output of my program is:
<br/>

Explain in detailed steps how the algorithms implemented in your program work. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it.
