## Details

### Day 8 

#### 1. Introduction to the project (10 minutes) 

* Explain to students the requirements for the collaborative project.
* Answer any questions students have regarding the project.

#### 2. Brainstorm ideas (15 minutes) 

1. Task students with brainstorming ideas for their project.
2. Encourage them to respond to prompts on the <a href="/unit-5/day-8-11/planning-your-program">Planning Your Program handout</a> page to help generate ideas.

#### 3. Pair and share (15minutes)

* Encourage students to organize into groups of 4 to 5 and have them share their ideas with their classmates.
* You can use the Group Generator program to randomly sort students.
* Students should offer feedback:
    * Which one sounds most interesting from a user's perspective?
    * Any resources or ideas you have that would help?

#### 4. Select Your partner and project idea (10 minutes)

* Students will select a partner:
    * Groups should be pairs of students, or if numbers allow no more than three students.
* Teams will select their project.
* Students should share their partner and their project idea with you before class ends.
* Students will need to divide tasks among each other to begin the workflow for the project.

#### 5. Homework

* Students should begin writing the pseudocode for their program.

### Day 9

#### 1. Finish your pseudocode (10 minutes)

* Give students no more than 10 minutes to finish up their pseudocode.
* If students are finished, they can begin creating their code while they wait on classmates to finish.

#### 2. Pair and share (10 minutes)

* Students should meet with their partner and share the pseudocode they have written.
* Students should offer feedback on the pseudocode:
* Is there something that does not seem to fit the projected plan?
* Do you have an idea of how they can make their program stronger?

#### 3. Set ip GitHub Repository for collaboration (5 minutes)

* Task one student in each group with creating a GitHub Repository for their project.
* Other students will accept the invitation from their partners to collaborate.

#### 4. Write code (25 minutes)

* Students should start writing their code.
* Encourage students to comment on their code as they write it.
* Remind them to create meaningful names for their variables.
* Encourage them to save their project periodically (to protect against unexpected technical issues).
* Remind them to test their program as they create it.

#### 5. Homework

* Students should evaluate how much time they will need to complete their project.
* If they know they will need more time than allotted in class, they will need to work on the program for homework.

### Day 10 

#### 1. Team meeting (5 minutes) 

* Students should pair up with their partner and share their program as it is written so far.
* Students should offer feedback on the program:
    * Is there anything in their program that does not reflect their plan properly?
    * Do you have an idea of how to make the program stronger?
    * Are they meeting all of the requirements of the project?

#### 2. Write code (20 minutes)

* Students should consider their classmate's feedback:
    * Do they need to modify anything based on the feedback they received.
* Encourage students to comment on their code as they write it.
* Encourage them to save their project periodically (to protect against unexpected technical issues).
* Remind them to test their program as they create it.

#### 3. Feedback from another group (10 minutes)

* Encourage groups to switch and test each other's games/program and give feedback based on the project rubric and user experience.

#### 4. Revise code (15 minutes)

* Based on feedback, encourage students to revise their code. 

#### 5. Homework 

* Students should evaluate how much time they will need to complete their project.
* The project ends tomorrow, and they will need to write responses explaining their program tomorrow.
* If they know they will need more time than allotted in class, they will need to work on the program for homework.
* Students should also review the prompts that they will need to complete by the end of the day tomorrow.

### Day 11

#### 1. Finalize code (10 minutes) 

* Students should finish their code, if they have not already.
* Task students with:
    * Publishing their project
    * Creating a screencast of their program running
    * Creating a screenshot of their program
    * Labeling the screenshot with the three algorithm implementations

#### 2. Respond to prompts and turn in project (40 minutes)

* Task students with completing the written responses to the prompts found on the Project Requirements & Responses page.
* Each partner needs to write responses to the prompts.
