## Reflection/Homework

1. In task #2, you implemented a basic “password checker.” What is one possible downside of the way that the code was implemented?

* There is no '*' character available with the on-screen Arcade keyboard.
* In the real world, we would not "hard-code" password values in code - these are looked up in an encrypted database, and each user may have a different password.

2. List at least two ways in which user input can be used in writing a text based game:

* In a Welcome message.
* As part of a game Leaderboard.
* To name a character in the game after the user.
