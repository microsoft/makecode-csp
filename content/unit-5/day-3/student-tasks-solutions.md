## Reflection

1. What needs to be added to a function so that it will return a value?
    * A Return block
2. If a function returns a value in one case, does it need to return a value in all cases?
    * No functions don't have to return a value. 
    * But if a function does have a Return block, then it will always return a value.
3. What happens if you call a function with a return value without storing or using the returned value?
    * Nothing happens
4. Where might return values be used in your previous projects?
    * Decisions, Change by Five programs
