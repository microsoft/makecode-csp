## Activity

### Tasks

**A**. Go to [Activity: Return Values](https://arcade.makecode.com/courses/csintro3/functions/returns). Complete student tasks 1-2.

#### Task 1

1. Create a function named aName.
2. Add a return value to aName, which returns “Bill”.
3. After calling the function, store the returned value in the variable theName.
4. Use game.splash to display theName.

#### Task 1 Challenge

1. Give aName a parameter name of type string.
2. Modify the return value to return name instead.

#### Task 2

1. Create a function named addOrRemove.
2. Add two parameters to the function: input of type number, and up of type Boolean.
3. Add an if ... else to the function.
4. if up is true, return input plus one, otherwise, return input minus one.

#### Task 2 Challenge

Create four test cases for addOrRemove, with different values for input and up that verify the function is working properly.

**B**. Based on what you have learned about return values, complete the tasks below:

### Tasks

#### Task 3

## Reflection 

1. What needs to be added to a function so that it will return a value?
2. If a function returns a value in one case, does it need to return a value in all cases?
3. What happens if you call a function with a return value without storing or using the returned value?
4. Where might return values be used in your previous projects?

## Homework 

* Complete the problem set at Problem Set: Returns.
* You may use block or text based programming for the problem sets.
* Comment your code as your work.
