## Overview

On Day 19, students will learn why sorting lists is important. They will learn how binary search algorithms work and the advantages of using them over sequential/linear searches. Students will then continue work on coding their simple sorting algorithm.

Day 19 will be about:

* Binary Search algorithm.
* Create and test a simple sorting algorithm in MakeCode.
