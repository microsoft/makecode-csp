## Unit 1

### Description of project

Students work in pairs to complete a design thinking challenge in which they select a user, identify a problem they can solve with an app, program, or device, and then use the design thinking process to create a paper prototype for their design and receive feedback on their design and modify their product based on that feedback. After revisions, each team will present their prototype to the class.

The introduction to the project can be found at <a href="/unit-1/day-8/design-challenge">Design Challenge - Discover, Ideate</a>.

Students complete a data research project in Unit 6. Students identify a question they want to research, create a survey to collect data, clean and analyze the data they collect through their survey, and then create a visual representation of the data in an infographic. Students then present their findings to the class.

The introduction to the project can be found at <a href="/unit-6/day-2/what-is-data-science">What is Data Science?</a> and specifically on [Slide 12 on Unit 6 Day 2's PowerPoint](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AqsgsTyHBmRBj2mWxLmeJYLj791G?e=YEbkxc). Students continue work on the project on Day 3 to learn about <a href="/unit-6/day-3/data-collection">Data Collection</a> and bias in surveys, on Day 4 to learn about <a href="/unit-6/day-4/data-ethics-survey-creation">Data Ethics and Survey Creation</a>, and on Day 5 for <a href="/unit-6/day-5/testing-sharing-your-survey">Testing and Sharing Your Survey</a>. Students then wait for their survey results. When they have collected all of their data, they pick back up with the project and apply what they learned about <a href="/unit-6/day-6/data-cleansing-visualization">Data Cleansing and Visualization</a> on Day 6 and then complete their findings by completing an <a href="/unit-6/day-7-10/infograpic-project">Infographic Project</a>.
