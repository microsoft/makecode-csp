AP Computer Science Principles is the equivalent of a first-semester, college-level introductory course in computer science for non-majors. The course introduces students to the field of computer science and explores five Big Ideas: (1) Creative development, (2) Data, (3) Algorithms and programming, (4) Computing systems and networks, and (5) Impact of computing. The course also integrates computational thinking practices, including: (1) Computational solution design, (2) Algorithms and program development, (3) Abstraction in program development, (4) Code analysis, (5) Computing innovations, and (6) Responsible computing. Students practice problem solving by developing algorithms and programs and incorporate abstraction into their programs. Students examine the importance of collaboration and diversity when designing, and examine the ethical concerns of designing computing innovations. Additionally, students explore the intended and unintended consequences (both beneficial and harmful) of computing innovations and computing systems. Students utilize MakeCode Arcade for the core programming components of the course.

## Supplies and materials requirements

The course curriculum is designed to be shared via a OneNote notebook, other digital distribution, or printing for a physical notebook. If you plan to print resources, students need a notebook to house their materials. Additionally, some activities require common classroom supplies, including: markers, scissors, post-it-notes, and cardstock. Furthermore, some of the unplugged activities require easily accessible, low-cost materials including, dice and cards.

## Technical requirements

Students will need:

* access to a computing device
* Internet connectivity
* Office 365 (if you choose to distribute the curriculum through OneNote)

## Accessibility 

Microsoft MakeCode [includes some core features which promote greater accessibility for everyone](https://makecode.com/accessibility). The menus, the JavaScript editor, and the documentation are accessible with the keyboard, assistive technologies, and a high contrast color mode. Additionally, students can use [immersive reader](https://education.microsoft.com/en-us/resource/9b010288) when they access the curriculum through either OneNote or Word.
