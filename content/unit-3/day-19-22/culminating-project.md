## Details

### Day 19

#### 1. Introduction to the project (10 minutes)

* Explain to students the requirements for the culminating project for Unit 3.
* Provide students the Project Requirements & Responses page and the Project Rubric and give them 5 minutes to review both documents.
* Answer any questions students have regarding the project.

#### 2. Brainstorm ideas (15 minutes)

* Task students with brainstorming ideas for their project.
* Encourage them to respond to prompts on the Planning Your Program page to help generate ideas.

#### 3. Pair and share (15minutes)

* Group students in pairs and have them share their ideas with their classmate.
* Students should offer feedback:
    * Which one sounds most interesting from a user's perspective?
    * Any resources or ideas you have that would help?

#### 4. Select Your project Idea (10 minutes)

* Students will select their project.
* Students should share their project idea with you before class ends.

#### 5. Homework

* Students should begin writing the pseudocode for their program.

### Day 20

#### 1. Finish Your pseudocode (10 minutes) 

* Give students no more than 10 minutes to finish up their pseudocode.
* If students are finished, they can begin creating their code while they wait on classmates finish.

#### 2. Pair and share (10 minutes) 

* Students should pair up with a classmate and share their project idea and the pseudocode they have written.
* Students should offer feedback on the pseudocode:
* Is there something that does not seem to fit the projected plan?
* Do you have an idea of how they can make their program stronger?

#### 3. Write code (30 minutes) 

* Students should start writing their code. 
* Encourage students to comment on their code as they write it. 
* Remind them to create meaningful names for their variables. 
* Encourage them to save their project periodically (to protect against unexpected technical issues). 
* Remind them to test their program as they create it. 

#### 4. Homework 

* Students should evaluate how much time they will need to complete their project. 
* If they know they will need more time than allotted in class, they will need to work on the program for homework.

### Day 21

#### 1. Write code (15 minutes)

* Students should continue writing their code. 
* Encourage students to comment on their code as they write it. 
* Remind them to create meaningful names for their variables. 
* Encourage them to save their project periodically (to protect against unexpected technical issues). 
* Remind them to test their program as they create it. 

#### 2. Pair and share (10 minutes)

* Students should pair up with the same classmate from yesterday and share their program as it is written so far. 
* Students should offer feedback on the program:
    * Is there anything in their program that does not reflect their plan properly?
    * Do you have an idea of how to make the program stronger?
    * Are they meeting all of the requirements of the project?

#### 3. Write code (15 minutes)

* Students should consider their classmate's feedback:
    * Do they need to modify anything based on the feedback they received.
* Encourage students to comment on their code as they write it.
* Encourage them to save their project periodically (to protect against unexpected technical issues).
* Remind them to test their program as they create it.

#### 4. Homework 

* Students should evaluate how much time they will need to complete their project.
* The project ends tomorrow, and they will need to write responses explaining their program tomorrow.
* If they know they will need more time than allotted in class, they will need to work on the program for homework.
* Students should also review the prompts that they will need to complete by the end of the day tomorrow.

### Day 22

#### Finalize code (10 minutes)

* Students should finish their code, if they have not already. 
* Task students with: 
    * Publishing their project. 
    * Creating a screencast of their program running. 
    * Creating a screenshot of their program. 
    * Labeling the screenshot with the three algorithm implementations. 

#### Respond to prompts and turn in project (40 minutes) 

* Task students with completing the written responses to the prompts found on the <a href="/unit-3/day-19-22/projects-requirements-responses">Project Requirements & Responses</a> page.
