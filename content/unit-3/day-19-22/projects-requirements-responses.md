## Your project must: 

:white_large_square: Implement an algorithm that includes and executes:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Sequencing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Selection<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Use relational operators and/or Boolean variables.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Incorporate a conditional statement or nested conditional statement.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Iteration:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Use a loop in some way<br/>
:white_large_square: Incorporate user input.<br/>
:white_large_square: Uses strings and/or integers variables.<br/>
:white_large_square: Ensure there is a visible output for your program.

Your project can also:

:white_large_square: Incorporate sprite(s) and/or projectile(s) variables.<br/>
:white_large_square: Incorporate calculations.<br/>

## When you create your program, you must test your program in at least two different ways. You will document those test cases here:

### First test case

Describe how you tested your program: 

Describe what condition in your program was being tested: 

Identify the result of the test case: 

### Second test case

Describe how you tested your program: 

Describe what condition in your program was being tested: 

Identify the result of the test case: 

## When your program is complete, you must respond to the following prompts and include your responses in the chart provided:


The link to my project is:

Snapshot of my code with labels of the algorithm implementations (sequencing, iteration, selection:

Screencast recording of my program running:

The purpose of my program is:

**Note**: Purpose is defined as the problem being solved or creative interest being pursued through the program.

How my program functions is:

**Note**: Program functionality is defined as the behavior of a program during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it.

The input of my program is:

The output of my program is:

Explain in detailed steps how the algorithms implemented (sequencing, iteration, selection) in your program work. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it.
