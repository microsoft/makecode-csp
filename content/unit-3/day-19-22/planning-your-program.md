## Your Plan

:white_large_square: Review the Project Requirements and Responses and the Project Rubric to understand the expectations.

:white_large_square: Brainstorm ideas for your project. Ask yourself the following questions:

* What do I want to create?
* Is there a project I have created this Unit that I want to develop further, or do I want to create something from scratch? 
* What is the goal of my program?
* Do I want to create a game? tell a story? help someone? solve a problem?
* What programming language will I use? Blocks? JavaScript? Python?
* What part of my program will meet the requirement for sequencing?
* What part of my program will meet the requirement for selection?
* What part of my program will meet the requirement for iteration?
* How will you incorporate strings and/or integers?
* Will you also incorporate sprites/projectiles?
* Will you have calculations?

:white_large_square: Make a plan for your program:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Write pseudocode or draw a flowchart of what the program will do; make sure the program has:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Sequencing (ordered steps)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Iteration (any kind of loop)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Selection (if, if else, else ifs, or switch case that responds to a condition)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: User input<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Output<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:white_large_square: Use of strings and/or integers<br/>
