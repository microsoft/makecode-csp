## Overview

In Day 14, students will apply what they learned in Day 13 through the randomness tutorials to code their own coin flip and die roll simulations. Students will work with a partner to create these programs utilizing pair programming strategies.

Day 14 will be about:

* Random simulation projects.
* Pair programming.
* Commenting on code throughout the development process.
