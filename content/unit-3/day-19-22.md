## Overview

On Days 19-22, students demonstrate their understanding of algorithm implementations by creating a program that includes (1) sequencing, (2) selection, and (3) iteration. Students are tasked with creating a program that seeks user input, uses strings and/or integer variables, and includes a visible output. Students can choose whether their program incorporates sprites and projectiles, or calculations.

Day 19 is about brainstorming, selecting an idea, formulating a plan, and completing a design document:

* Introduction to Unit 3 project.
* Brainstorm ideas for the project.
* Decide on the purpose of the program they will create.
* Write the pseudocode for the program they plan to create.

Days 20 and 21 are:

* Workdays
* Pair and Share to receive feedback from a classmate

Day 22:

* Finalize programs
* Response to prompts
* Submit your project
