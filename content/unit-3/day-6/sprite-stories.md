### Learning Objectives

* [CRD-2.G](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. [4.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
* [AAP-1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Represent a value with a variable.â€‚[3.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)

### Essential Knowledge 

* [CRD-2.G.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed.
* [CRD-2.G.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Programmers should document a program throughout its development.
* [AAP-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values.
* [AAP-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Using meaningful variable names helps with the readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables.

## Details

### 1. Variables/Sprites review (5 minutes)

* What types of variables are there in MakeCode? Sprite, integer, string, Boolean, and lists.
* How do you name a variable? Any way you like, but make it meaningful so you know what it is later.
* What is a sprite? An object that has properties that you can change.
* Can a variable change? Yes.

### 2. Story development (20 minutes)

* Note: If you have a smaller sized class, you can give students more time to finish their projects.
* Students will have 20 minutes to finalize their story.
* Encourage students to document their work with comment throughout the development process.
* When students finish their story, they should publish it and create a link.
* ou could have students post their finished story to the Sprite Stories Submissions page in the Collaboration space of the OneNote notebook.
* Encourage students to save a copy of their program to their computer as well. 

### 3. Share your stories! (25 minutes)

* Students will share their stories with their classmates.
* Ask for volunteers or use your system of selecting students to present.
* Encourage students to share the information on the slide.

### 4. Reflection

(If you run out of time, you may also assign this as individual homework.)
Students should complete their reflection in their OneNote.

* What are some different types of medium you can use to tell a story?
* What is an advantage to making your story on a computer rather than on a piece of paper?
* What is a disadvantage to making your story this way?
* Did you think of computer programs being a creative expression?
