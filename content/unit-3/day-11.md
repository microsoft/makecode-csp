## Overview

On Day 11, students will learn about Boolean variables. They will learn how computers make decisions using Boolean logic, and they will discuss where Booleans are in everyday life. They will practice using Boolean logic operators by creating a code segment that incorporates Boolean logic operators and a conditional statement. They will also learn about relational operators and how they evaluate to a Boolean value. Students will then practice using relational operators by creating a code segment that incorporates one.

Day 11 will cover:

* Strings review
* Discuss how computers make decisions
* Introduce Boolean variables
* Boolean logic operators
* Relational operators
