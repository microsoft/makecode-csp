### Questions

Answer the following reflection questions regarding the projectiles from sprites activities:

1. How can we make a sprite move from another sprite? Explain the block code to use.
2. Give examples of using on overlap events in a game to make projectiles that are decorations, laser beams, and coins. Explain each.
3. Create a hypothesis about why it might be useful to make projectiles have ghost on.
