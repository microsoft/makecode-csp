### Essential Knowledge 

* [CRD-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=39) The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
* [CRD-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=39) Acomputing innovation can be physical (e.g., self-driving car), nonphysical computing software (e.g., picture editing software), or a nonphysical computing concept (e.g., e-commerce).
* [CRD-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=39) The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
* [CRD-2.B.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software.
* [CRD-2.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program. 
* [AAP-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values.
* [AAP-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Using meaningful variable names helps with the readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables.
* [AAP-2.K.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=83) The exam reference sheet provides 

```
Text:

REPEAT n TIMES
{
 <block of statements>
}

Block:

REPEAT n TIMES
    block of statements in which the block of statements is executed n times.
```

* [AAP-2.K.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=84) The exam reference sheet provides 
```
Text: 

REPEAT UNTIL(condition) 
{ 
 <block of statements> 
} 

Block: 

REPEAT UNTIL 
    block of statements condition in which the code in block of statements
    is repeated until the Boolean expression condition evaluates to true.  
```

* [AAP-2.K.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=83) Iteration statements change the sequential flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times, until a stopping condition is met.

## Details

### 1. Projectiles review (5 minutes)

* What are projectiles?
* How are projectile sprites different that player sprites?
* What can projectiles be used for?
* What are the benefits of using projectiles rather than regular sprites?

### 2. Projectiles from Sprites Activities (15 minutes)

* Direct students to the Projectiles from Sprites Activities page.
* Instruct students to complete Section A of the page; students will:
    * Complete Tasks 1 and 2 on the Projectiles from Sprites tutorial page.
    * Respond to the reflection questions.

### 3. Revise Sprite Stories (30 minutes)

* Task students with going back to their second Sprite Story (with animation) and using projectiles to revise it.
* Students should:
    * Consider where in the story projectiles could further the story line or add an interesting element to the story.
    * Add at least two projectiles that incorporate movement to make it more interesting.
* Remind students to share their work and copy the link to the Section B of the Projectiles from Sprites Activities page.
