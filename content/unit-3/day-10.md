## Overview

On Day 10, students will learn about string variables, concatenation, and substrings. They will use string variables to create a program where a sprite asks for user input and then greets the user by name. Students will learn how to use string concatenation to join two or more strings together by modifying their program to have the sprite greet the user by first and last name. Finally, students will learn about substrings with a parts of speech project where they will create a sentence and then create a program to pull out specific parts of speech.

Day 10 will cover:

* String variables
* String concatenation
* Substrings
