* [CRD-2.G](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. [4.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
* [AAP-1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Represent a value with a variable. [3.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
* AAP-2.G Express an algorithm that uses selection without using a programming language. 2.A

Determine the result of conditional statements. [4.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=23)

### Essential Knowledge 

* [CRD-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
* [CRD-2.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program. 
* [CRD-2.G.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Programmers should document a program throughout its development.
* [AAP-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values.
* [AAP-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Using meaningful variable names helps with the readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables.
* AAP-2.G.1 Selection determines which parts of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false.  
* [AAP-2.H.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=80) Conditional statements, or “if-statements,” affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression.
* [AAP-2.H.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=80) The exam reference sheet provides
    * Text: IF(condition) {    &lt;block of statements&gt; }
    * Block: IF condition block of statements in which the code in block of statements is executed if the Boolean expression condition evaluates to true; no action is taken if condition evaluates to false.

## Details

### 1. Booleans and Relational Operators Review (5 minutes)

* What is a Boolean value?
    * Variable that can only be true/false.
* How do you test if a Boolean variable is true/false?
    * Use an if statement.
    * Explain conditional statements.
* What is another way to define something as true or false?
    * Relational operators.
    * Relational operators are used to test the relationship between two variables, expressions, or values.
    * A comparison using a relational operator evaluates to a Boolean value.

### 2. Conditional Statements (5 minutes)

* Discuss the conditional statements on the exam reference sheet.
* Review the if and if-else statement used in our lesson yesterday.
* Code tracing for Drive or Bike User Input program.
* Define nested conditionals.

### 3. Putting it all Together Project (40 minutes)

* Review the requirements for the Putting it all together Project.
* Students will create a program that:
    * Asks for user input.
    * Incorporates the use of string, integer, and Boolean variables.
    * Uses relational operators.
    * Incorporates conditional statements.

### 4.Homework

* Students will do the following for homework:
    * Take a screenshot of their code segment.
    * Create a screencast of their program running.
    * Answer the following questions:
        * What is the purpose and function of their program?
        * What is the input and output of their program?
        * Explain what the nested conditional in the program does.
* Students will enter all of their work on the Putting it All Together Project page.
