### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments

1. Roll the Dice Activity (10 minutes)
2. What is Randomness? (15 minutes)
3. Randomness in Games (25 minutes)

### Learning Objectives

* [AAP-3.E](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=98) For generating random values:
    * a. Write expressions to generate possible values. [2.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
    * b. Evaluate expressions to determine the possible results [4.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
* AAP-3.F For simulations:
    * a. Explain how computers can be used to represent real-world phenomena or outcomes 1.A.
    * b. Compare simulations with real-world contexts.â€‚1.D

### Essential Knowledge 

* [AAP-3.E.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=98) The exam reference sheet provides Text: RANDOM(a, b) Block: RANDOM a, b which generates and returns a random integer from a to b, inclusive. Each result is equally likely to occur. For example, RANDOM(1, 3) could return 1, 2, or 3.
* [AAP-3.E.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=98) Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result.
* AAP-3.F.3 Simulations often mimic real-world events with the purpose of drawing inferences, allowing investigation of a phenomenon without the constraints of the real world.
* AAP-3.F.4 The process of developing an abstract simulation involves removing specific details or simplifying functionality.
* AAP-3.F.5 Simulations can contain bias derived from the choices of real world elements that were included or excluded.
* AAP-3.F.6 Simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical for experiments (e.g., too big, too small, too fast, too slow, too expensive, or too dangerous).
* AAP-3.F.7 Simulations facilitate the formulation and refinement of hypotheses related to the objects or phenomena under consideration.
* AAP-3.F.8 Random number generators can be used to simulate the variability that exists in the real world.

## Details

### 1. Roll the dice activity (10 minutes) 

* Organize students into pairs.
* You can use the Group Generator program to randomly sort students.
* Distribute die or share random die roll generator with students.
* Have students work in pairs to roll a die 30 times and record the results of each roll.
* Collect data from each group.
* Compare data of the entire class to the data of each small group.
* Discuss the pattern that should eventually present itself with enough rolls (that a die roll has a 1/6 chance of landing on any given side).

### 2. What is Randomness (15 minutes)

* Define randomness.
* Discuss when things happen by chance in real life.
* Play video Is Anything Truly Random?
* Ask students to read the How Computers Generate Random Numbers article.
* Discuss why we use random numbers.
* Discuss the difference between true random vs. Pseudorandom.
* Define simulations.
* Explain how simulations are used.
* Discuss Randomness in games.

### 3. Randomness tutorials (25 minutes)

* Explain where you can find the random block in MakeCode Arcade.
* Explain how it works.
* Discuss the instruction and explanation of Random on the Exam Reference Sheet.
* Direct students to Activity: Random Sprite Location.
* Distribute the Tutorials on Randomness handout or direct students to find it in their OneNote notebook.
* Instruct students to complete Tasks 1-3.
* Remind students to publish their programs and add the link to their code on the handout.
* Direct students to respond to the reflection questions on the page when they finish the tasks.
