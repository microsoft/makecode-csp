## Questions

Describe how the ability to generate a random value can make a game more interesting and/or challenging.

## Reflection/Homework

Make a hypothesis of a good use of pick random that you would like to design into a future game - especially something we donâ€™t know how to do yet. Be descriptive of the game and how a random value would be needed.
