## Overview

On Day 7, students will begin with a review of algorithms and will discuss how to determine the value of a variable. Students will then learn about algorithms that determine the path of a robot and how the robot in the AP CSP exam moves according to the Exam Reference Sheet. Students will then practice tracking the path of a robot according to an algorithm and practice tracing code that have utilize sequencing, selection, and iteration algorithms. Finally, students will learn what a procedure is and how it can be used in an algorithm that determines the path of a robot. Students will work independently to practice what they learned.

Day 7 will be about:

* Algorithms
    * Sequencing
    * Selection
    * Iteration
* Variables
* Assignment operators in a program
* Algorithms that determine the path of a robot
