### Learning Objectives 

* AAP-2.B Represent a step-by-step algorithmic process using sequential code statements. 2.B
* [CRD-2.I](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=46) For errors in an algorithm or program: a.) Identify the error. b.) Correct the error. Computational Thinking Practices: Skills [4.C](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
* [CRD-2.C](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=42) Identify input(s) to a program. [3.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)

### Essential Knowledge

AAP-2.B.1 Sequencing is the application of each step of an algorithm in the order in which the code statements are given.
AAP-2.B.2 A code statement is a part of program code that expresses an action to be carried out.
AAP-2.B.6 Sequential statements execute in the order they appear in the code segment.
* [CRD-2.I.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=46) A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed.
* [CRD-2.C.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=42) An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.
* [CRD-2.C.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=42) Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution.

## Details

### 1. Algorithm review (5 minutes)

* What are the three types of constructs used in algorithm implementations? 
* How does a debugger help your coding?

### 2. Introduce Events (10 minutes)

* Define an event.
* Explain what an event handler is.
* Identify event handlers in a program.
* Explore event handlers in MakeCode.
* Trace code for the Which Button? program.
* Follow an event in MakeCode debugger.

### 3. Create Galga game (25 minutes)

* Guide students through creating a game that uses several event handlers: 
    * On start
    * On game update
    * On A button pressed
    * On sprite overlaps
* Ask students to publish their game and post the link to their <a href="/unit-3/day-4/my-galga-game">My Galga Game</a> page.
* Encourage students to save their game to their computer also.
* Have students play their game a few times to see how it works.

### 4. Modify Galga game (10 minutes)

* Encourage students to modify their Galga game to make it unique.
* Students should explore other game features and insert items they feel will work with their vision for the game.
* Show them how to learn what different blocks do by using the Help feature.
* Encourage students to add comments to the blocks they add.
* Ask students to re-publish their game and add the link to their <a href="/unit-3/day-4/my-galga-game">My Galga Game</a>.
