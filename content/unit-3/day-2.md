## Overview

On Day 2, students will begin with a discussion of where algorithms can be found in our everyday lives. Students will share algorithms that they consider impactful on society. Students will further explore the types of algorithm implementations, how differently written algorithms can reach the same result, and how similar looking algorithms can yield different side effects or results. Students will also learn about a few types of algorithms and will code a simple algorithm in MakeCode Arcade using the algorithm for adding all ages in the room one after another.

Day 2 will cover: 

* Where algorithms are used.
* The three types of algorithm implementations:
    * Sequencing
    * Selection
    * Iteration
* How different algorithms can yield the same results.
* How similar looking algorithms can yield different side effects or results.
* Types of algorithms that calculate equations.
* Code an algorithm in MakeCode Arcade.
