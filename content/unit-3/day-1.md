## Overview

On Day 1, students will learn what algorithms are by observing that humans and computers can do the same things through completing a series of tasks. Students will discuss situations where humans are the best choice for the job, and those where computers are better suited. Students will learn where algorithms originated, learn about the three types of algorithm implementations, and write an algorithm.

Day 1 is about observing the ubiquity of algorithms and their impact on individuals and society:

* Humans vs. Computers.
* What are algorithms?
* Where did they originate?
* Writing algorithms.
* Algorithms in daily life.
* Reflect on the impact of algorithms on individuals and society.
