### Learning Objectives

* [CRD-2.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) Explain how a program or code segment functions. [4.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
* [CRD-2.G](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. [4.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
* [AAP-1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Represent a value with a variable. [3.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
* AAP-2.E For relationships between two variables, expressions, or values:
    * Write expressions using relational operators. 2.B
    * Evaluate expressions that use relational operators. 4.B
* AAP-2.F

### Essential Knowledge 

* [CRD-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
* [CRD-2.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program. 
* [CRD-2.G.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Programmers should document a program throughout its development.
* [AAP-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values.
* [AAP-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Using meaningful variable names helps with the readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables.
* AAP-2.E.1 A Boolean value is either true or false.
* AAP-2.E.2
* AAP-2.F.1
* AAP-2.F.2
* AAP-2.F.3
* AAP-2.F.4
* AAP-2.F.5

## Details

### 1. Variables/Strings recap (5 minutes)

* What is a variable? A variable is an abstraction insider a program that can hold a value.
* What types of variables are there? Sprite, integers, sStrings, Boolean, and lists.
* How do you name a variable? Any way you like, but make it meaningful so you know what it is later.
* What is a string? text
* How do designate a string variable? Surround it with quotes.
* What is the fancy word for join? Concatenate
* What can be joined? Strings can be joined with integers when helped with a join block.
* Can a string variable change? Yes! It can be changed as an event occurs or with user input.

### 2. Introduce Boolean variables (10 minutes)

* Discuss the difference between how humans make decisions compared to how computers make decisions.
* Define Boolean variables.
* Discuss Booleans in everyday life.
* Evaluate Boolean variable within the "Sleepy" code segment.
* Discuss Boolean logic operators in MakeCode Arcade.
* Task students with completing the exercises on the Boolean Operator Practice page.
* Discuss Boolean logic operators on the Exam Reference Sheet.

### 3. Coding with Boolean Logic Operators (15 minutes) 

* Task students with:
    * Create a code segment that includes a conditional statement based on something they experience.
    * Examples include:
        * Having money to eat with friends.
        * Studying for a test.
        * Preparing for a concert, play, game, or meet
    * Students will create a variable related to the activity.
    * Set it to either true or false. 
    * Create an event that happens if the variable is true.
* When they are finished: 
    * Have students save their code to their computer.
    * Ask students to share their code and post the link to it on the My Code Segments for Boolean Activities page. 
    * Depending on your class collaboration system, you can have students copy and paste their program links in an email, LMS system, Class OneNote, or other tool.

### 4. Introduce Relational Operators (5 minutes)

* Discuss what relational operators are.
* Discuss relational operators or comparison statements in MakeCode Arcade.
* Discuss relational operators on the Exam Reference Sheet.
* Evaluate relational operators within the "Drive or Bike" code segment.

### 5. Coding with Relational Operators (15 minutes)

* Task students with:
    * Create a code segment that includes a relational operator.
    * Examples include:
        * Voting age
        * Discount at the movies for specific age
    * Students will create a variable for the qualifying event.
    * Determine which relational operator they will use.
    * Determine what will happen when that relational operator is true (or false).
* When they are finished:
    * Have students save their code to their computer.
    * Ask students to share their code and post the link to it on the My Code Segments for Boolean Activities page. 
    * Depending on your class collaboration system, you can have students copy and paste their program links in an email, LMS system, Class OneNote, or other tool.

### 6. Homework 

(Students should complete their reflection in their OneNote.)
* How does using Boolean variables affect how your code is written?
