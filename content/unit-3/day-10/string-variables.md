* [CRD-2.G](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. [4.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
* [AAP-1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Represent a value with a variable. [3.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
AAP-1.C Represent a list or string using a variable. 3.A
AAP-2.A Express an algorithm that uses sequencing without using a programming language. 2.A
AAP-2.D Evaluate expressions that manipulate strings. 4.B

### Essential Knowledge

* [CRD-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
* [CRD-2.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program.
* [CRD-2.G.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Programmers should document a program throughout its development.
* [AAP-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values.
* [AAP-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Using meaningful variable names helps with the readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables.
* AAP-1.C.4 A string is an ordered sequence of characters.
* AAP-2.A.2 Beyond visual and textual programming languages, algorithms can be expressed in a variety of ways, such as natural language, diagrams, and pseudocode.
* AAP-2.D.1 String concatenation joins together two or more strings  end-to-end to make a new string.

## Details

### 1. Integers Review (5 minutes)

* What is an expression? It can consist of a value, a variable, an operator, or a procedure call that returns a value.
* How many values can an expression evaluate to? 1
* What is the order of operations for math operators? PEDMAS
* How is working with integers different than working with sprites? Sprites have properties.
* Did you use any of the Math blocks you researched?

### 2. Introduce String Variables (10 minutes)

* Define characters in programming.
* Define string in programming.
* Discuss where we see strings when we:
    * Use computers
    * Play computer game
* Define string variables further.
* Lead students through creating a program where a sprite uses a string.
* Introduce string concatenation.
* Change program so sprite says "Hello World."

### 3. Sprite Greets You By Name Program (15 minutes)

* Lead students through creating a program where a sprite greets you by name:
    * With direction, students will first create the program to greet you by your first name.
* Task students to then create a program where the sprite greets you by first and last name.
* Debrief:
    * How did you know what to do?
    * Were your first and last name joined together without any separation?
    * How did you fix it?
* Ask students to share their code, copy the link, and paste it to "My Code Segments for String Activities" page.

### 4. Parts of Speech Program (20 minutes)

* Introduce substring.
* Lead students through creating a program that pulls out the nouns from a sentence.
* Task students to then create a program each sprite pulls out a different part of speech from the sentence.
* Students must:
    * Use the substring block.
    * Optionally use the join block if there is more than one word.
* When students are finished:
    * Create a link to their program using the Share button.
    * Add their link to their "My Code Segments for String Activities" page.
    * Depending on your class collaboration system, you can have students copy and paste their program links in an email, LMS system, Class OneNote, or other tool.
    * Alternately, they can download their programs as .png files on their local computers or on a shared file system. 
    * Note - by default most browsers will download files to the "Download" folder on a computer.  You can change this behavior if you want by configuring the browser settings (instructions in PowerPoint deck).

### 5. Homework

* How is working with strings different that working with integers or sprites?
* Think of all the places in real life you enter a string and it triggers an action
* Research some of the text blocks by hovering, right click, and select help
