## Overview

On Day 8, students will continue learning about variables. They will learn more about the data type integers (or number), exploring use of number variables and math operators. Students will be reminded of how to create a variable and will be guided through creating a button counter using number variables. Students will then learn about arithmetic operators used in coding and will complete tutorials and challenges related to math operators with variables. They will explore creating equations, leading to students creating a temperature conversion program.

Day 8 will be about:

* Integer variables.
* Math Operators with Integers.
