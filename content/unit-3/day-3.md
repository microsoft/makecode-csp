## Overview

Students will review the building blocks of algorithms and examine how flowcharts can help guide creation of algorithms. Students are reminded of the three types of algorithm implementations: sequence, selection, and iteration. Students learn about data values. Students are guided through the process of creating a program for adding all ages in the room. Students will learn about the debugger mode in MakeCode and how debugging helps programmers when they are checking their code. Finally, students will learn about program documentation and the importance of documenting their development of programs. Students will learn how to make comments in MakeCode Arcade.

Day 3 will cover:

* Flowcharts and their connection to algorithms
* The three types of algorithm implementation:
    * Sequence
    * Selection
    * Iteration
* Creating a program for adding ages
* Debugger mode
* Program documentation
* Comments in code
