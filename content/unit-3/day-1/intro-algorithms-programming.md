### Learning Objectives 

* [AAP-2.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=75) Express an algorithm that uses sequencing without using a programming language. [2.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=23)
* [AAP-2.L](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=85) Compare multiple algorithms to determine if they yield the same side effect or result. [1.D](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=23)
* [AAP-2.M](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=86) For algorithms:
    1. Create algorithms. [2.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=23)

### Essential Knowledge

* [AAP-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=75) An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task.
* [AAP-2.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=75) Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration.
* [AAP-2.B.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=75) Sequencing is the application of each step of an algorithm in the order in which the code statements are given.
* [AAP-2.L.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=85) Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks.
* [*AP-2.L.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=85) Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results.
* [AAP-2.M.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=86) Algorithms can be created from an idea, by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying existing algorithms.
* [AAP-2.M.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=86) Using existing correct algorithms as building blocks for constructing another algorithm has benefits such as reducing development time, reducing testing, and simplifying the identification of errors.

## Details

### 1. Humans and computers can do the same things (10 minutes)

* Human vs. Computer demonstration.
* Demonstrate that humans and computers can do the same things, though they each do certain things better than the other.
* Lead a discussion with students about who did the jobs better, human or computer, and why.

### 2. What is an Algorithm? (10 minutes)

* Define algorithm.
* Play video [What's an algorithm? - David J. Malan](https://youtu.be/6hfOvs8pY1k)).
* Discuss how every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration.
* Share examples from real life.
* Encourage students to share their own examples.

### 3. Where did algorithms come from? (5 minutes) 

* Show video (BBC Ideas) [Why algorithms are called algorithms | BBC Ideas]((https://youtu.be/oRkNaF0QvnI)).

### 4. Using flowchart symbols (20 minutes)

* Introduce flowchart symbols.
* Distribute Flowchart Symbols handout.
* Work with students to create a flowchart for the "counting the people in the room algorithm" in the  "What's an algorithm?" video.
* Have students work in pairs to create an algorithm to add all ages in the room one after another.
* You can use the [Group Generator](https://arcade.makecode.com/31859-57060-41272-95490) program to randomly sort students.
* Give students 3-5 minutes to write their algorithm.
* When they are finished, ask them to share their algorithms.
* Emphasize:
    * Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks.
    * When they created their algorithm, they may have combined existing algorithms or modified existed algorithms.
    * Using existing correct algorithms as building blocks for constructing another algorithm has benefits such as reducing development time, reducing testing, and simplifying the identification of errors.

### 5. Homework- Where else are algorithms?

* Students can complete their <a href="/unit-3/day-1/reflection">Reflection</a> in their OneNote or other journal location.
* How do algorithms affect our daily lives? Our society?
* Where else are algorithms?
    * Research an area where algorithms are used (travel/transportation, shipping, retail, gaming, medicine, science, climate, society, etc.).   
    * Record your research source(s).
    * Be prepared to share in class.
