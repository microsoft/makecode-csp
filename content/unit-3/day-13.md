## Overview

In Day 13, we will cover the use of random numbers in game development to make games interesting and unpredictable. We will start with an unplugged activity where student-pairs roll a die 30 times and record their results. The class will then collect the results from each group and discuss the randomness of rolling die. We will then discuss whether random is truly random and learn about how computers create random number generation. Students will then learn how computers can be used to create simulations of complex real-world phenomenon. Students will then explore how random numbers provide an element of chance to our games that make them look and feel more natural. Students will then complete tutorials on how to create random number ranges, how to set a sprite to a random position using a button event, and how to check for random overlap with many sprites.

Day 13 will be about:

* The concept of randomness
* How computers generate random numbers
* When randomness is needed/used
* True random vs. pseudorandom
* Random command in coding
* Randomness in games
