## Projectiles

### Activity

Go to [Activity: Projectile Sprites](https://arcade.makecode.com/courses/csintro1/loops/projectiles) and complete student tasks 1-3.

#### Task 1

Modified code for ball to fall at a rate of 50.
Created a second projectile that goes up the screen at the rate of 50.

**Shared project**: [projectiles task1](https://arcade.makecode.com/54655-88238-43250-15910)

#### Task 1 Challenge

Made something happen when the two projectiles overlap one another.

**Shared project**: [projectiles task1 challenge](https://arcade.makecode.com/78082-58060-25738-62202)

#### Task 2a

Modified code so each time a projectile is create one point is added.
Modified the create projectile block so each spawned meteor moves down the screen at a rate of 50.

**Shared project**: [Random Dodge](https://arcade.makecode.com/23864-00251-85461-06551)

#### Task 2a Challenge

Made the projectile move at a random rate between 40 and 60.

**Shared project**: [Random Dodge Challenege](https://arcade.makecode.com/80487-02817-81999-33660)

#### Task 2b

* Start with sample code.
* Place code in a for index loop.
* Modified the code so 13 projectiles are created every 300 ms.
* Modified the code so that each projectile starts further down the screen on each iteration.

## Reflection/Homework

1. How did using a loop in Task 2b help reduce the amount of blocks that were used?
2. What are the benefits of using projectiles rather than normal sprites?
