### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments 

1. Loops Review (5 minutes)
2. Introduction to Projectiles (10 minutes)
3. Projectiles Activities (35 minutes)
4. Reflection/Homework

### Learning Objectives 

* [AAP-2.K](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=83) For iteration:
    * a. Write iteration statements. [2.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
    * b. Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements. [4.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)

### Essential Knowledge 

* [AAP-2.K.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=83) Iteration statements change the sequential flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times, ntil a stopping condition is met. 
* [AAP-2.K.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=83) The exam reference sheet provides:

```
Text:

REPEAT n TIMES
{
 <block of statements>
}

Block:

REPEAT n TIMES
block of statements in which the block of statements is executed n times.
```

* [AAP-2.K.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=84) The exam reference sheet provides:

```
Text:

REPEAT UNTIL(condition)
{ 
 <block of statements> 
} 

Block: 

REPEAT UNTIL 
block of statements condition in which the code in block of statements is repeated until the Boolean expression condition evaluates to true.  
```

## Details

### 1. Loops review (5 minutes) 

* Discuss the answers to the following questions:
    * What are loops?
    * What are the different types of loops in MakeCode and how is each one used?
    * How can using loops making your code better?

### 2. Introduction to projectiles (10 minutes)

* Review sprites.
* Remind students of our use of Projectiles in the Galga game.
* Define and discuss the qualities of projectiles.
* Direct students to the <a href="/unit-3/day-16/projectiles-activities">Projectiles Activities</a> page and guide them through Section A of the page (i.e., the Flying Bird activity).
* Discuss what happens when they change the numbers for vx and vy.
* Discuss what happens when they change vx or vy to a negative number.
* Demonstrate the concept that projectiles are automatically destroyed when they leave the visible screen:
    * Students will add code that changes the score when the projectile is destroyed.
    * Students will observe when the score changes.

### 3. Projectiles activities (35 minutes)

* Direct students to the <a href="/unit-3/day-16/projectiles-activities">Projectiles Activities</a> page.
* Task them with completing Section B of the page.

### 4. Reflection/Homework

If you run out of time, you may also assign this as individual homework
Students should complete their reflection.

* How did using a loop in Task 2b help reduce the amount of blocks that were used?
* What are the benefits of using projectiles rather than normal sprites?
