## Details

### 0. Before class 

* Use AP Classroom to curate some robot questions students can practice.
* Assign the questions to students so the questions will be available when it is time for students to practice independently.
* Print the Robot Practice Field document to give students:
    * Students can use it to help them track the robot's path according to the code.
    * If you have erasers or Lego people you can give students one to use as their robot.

### 1. Algorithm review (5 minutes)

* Remind students of the definition of an algorithm.
* Remind students of the existing algorithms you have already discussed:
    * Determining the maximum or minimum value of two or more numbers.
    * Computing the sum or average of two or more numbers.
    * Identifying if an integer is or is not evenly divisible by another integer.
* Introduce a fourth example of existing algorithms:
    * Determining a robot's path through a maze.
* Review the three types of programming constructs used in algorithmic implementations:
    * Sequencing
    * Iteration
    * Selection
* Review Variables:
    * Remind student of the definition of a variable. 
    * Discuss what an assignment operator does in a program.
    * Explain that the value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned.
    * Practice determining the value of a variable.

### 3. Introduce the Robot on the AP CSP Exam (5 minutes)

* Use the slides to demonstrate the movement of the robot.
* Discuss the instructions and explanations regarding robots on the Exam Reference Sheet.
* Remind students of the definition of iteration.
* Discuss the instructions and explanations regarding iteration on the Exam Reference Sheet.

### 4. Individual Robot practice (10 minutes) 

* Direct students to either AP Classroom.
* Instruct them to complete the assignment you created.
* If students do not finish (and the assignment does not involve secure questions on AP Classroom), students can finish for homework.

### 5. Robots in MakeCode Arcade (10 minutes)

* Direct students to the Robots in MakeCode Arcade page.
* Instruct them to play the Asphodel Follows Directions game, and experiment with the Robot Drawing program.
