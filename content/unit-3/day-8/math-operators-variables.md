Go to Activity: [Math Operators with Variables](https://arcade.makecode.com/courses/csintro1/intro/variable-math).

Complete student tasks 1-5.

## Tasks

### Task 1

**Code**: Test at least three different equations.

**Shared project**: Note: Simply enter the code you created to try different equations. It is okay that it does not show how many equations you tried.

**Code**:

**Shared project**:

### Task 1 Challenge

**Code**: Make longer addition equations so that the code calculates the sum of 5 or more numbers.

**Shared project**:

### Tasks 2

**Code**: Add a thirdNumber variable. Create an equation using both the addition operator (+) and the multiplication operator (*).

**Shared project**:

### Tasks 3

**Code**: Add a fourthNumber variable. Create an equation using 3 different operators.

**Shared project**:

### Task 3 Challenge

**Code**: Create an equation using all 4 basic operators and at least 5 unique variables.

**Shared project**:

### Tasks 4

**Code**: Create 2 variables 

Initialized temp C with common Celsius temp. Create an equation using a formula. Show the temp in a splash screen.

**Shared project**:

### Task 4 Challenge

**Code**: Create an equation for converting back to Celsius. Note: Be sure to read the directions carefully. It suggests that you move to JavaScript to make sure the calculation works properly.

**Shared project**:

### Task 5

**Code**: Debugging

**Shared project**:

## Reflection/Homework 

1. In JavaScript, what is the resulting value of answer for answer = 5+3*2?  Explain why the answer is not 30.
2. How is putting operators and numbers into a calculator different than writing in code (example: 2+3+4*4)? Explain.
3. Research and describe 2 other Math Operators found in the math menu in MakeCode (hover over values for more information).
4. What did you learn about variables, data types, strings, and join?
