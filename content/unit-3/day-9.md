## Overview

On Day 9, students will continue working with number variables. They will modify their temperature converter coded yesterday to allow for user input. Students will then create a program for calculating a 20% tip for a restaurant bill. Students will then be introduced to mathematical expressions and the modulus operator. Students will use JavaScript or Python in MakeCode Arcade to see how MOD works in a program. They will then work in pairs to apply what they have learned to create a program that converts military time to standard time, using modulus. For both programs, students will respond to prompts that ask them to identify the user input for the program, the output of the program, the purpose, and its functionality. Students will also include a screenshot of their program.

Day 9 will be about:

* How to add user input in a program.
* Using pseudocode to plan their programs.
* Expressions.
* Order of operation in mathematics.
* The modulus operator.
