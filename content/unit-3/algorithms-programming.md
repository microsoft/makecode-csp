## Overview

In Unit 3, students will be introduced to programming concepts while using Microsoft MakeCode Arcade. Students will learn the three types of algorithm implementations: sequencing, selection, and iteration. Students will develop an understanding of programming concepts such as algorithms, program flow, events, variables (sprites, integers, strings, and Booleans), conditional statements, randomness, loops, projectiles, and text-based programming. Students will apply computational thinking practices (i.e. iterative design, debugging) to their work throughout the unit. Students will also explore practice tracking the path of a robot according to an algorithm and practice code tracing that utilizes sequencing, selection, and iteration. The unit culminates with students implementing what they learned to create a program that incorporates all three algorithm implementations (sequencing, selection, and iteration) and either solves a problem or expresses creativity through game development.

The questions students will explore in this unit include:

* How can we store data in a program to solve problems?
* What might happen if you completed the steps in your regular morning routine to get ready and go to school in a different order? How might the reordering affect the decisions you make each morning?
* How do video games group the different actions for a player based on what key is pressed on the keyboard or controller? How do apps group different actions together based on user interaction, such as pressing buttons?
* What types of problems can be solved more easily with a computer, and what types can be solved more easily without a computer?

## Big Ideas

[Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming (AAP)](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=66)

Programmers integrate algorithms and abstraction to create programs for creative purposes and to solve problems. Using multiple program statements in a specified order, making decisions, and repeating the same process multiple times are the building blocks of programs. Incorporating elements of abstraction, by breaking problems down into interacting pieces, each with their own purpose, makes writing complex programs easier. Programmers need to think algorithmically and use abstraction to define and interpret processes that are used in a program.

[Big Idea 1: Creative Development (CRD)](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=24)

When developing computing innovations, developers can use a formal, iterative design process or a less rigid process of experimentation. While using either approach, developers will encounter phases of investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, and testing. Additionally, collaboration is an important tool at any phase of development, because considering multiple perspectives allows for improvement of innovations.

## Enduring Understandings

AAP-1 To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.

AAP-2 The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.

AAP-3 Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.
