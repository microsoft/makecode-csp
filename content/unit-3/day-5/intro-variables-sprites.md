### Learning Objectives

* [CRD-2.G](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. [4.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)
* [AAP-1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Represent a value with a variable. [3.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23)

### Essential Knowledge 

* [CRD-2.G.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed.
* [CRD-2.G.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Programmers should document a program throughout its development.
* [AAP-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values.
* [AAP-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=70) Using meaningful variable names helps with the readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables.

## Details

### 1. Events recap (5 minutes)

* Ask the following questions:
    * What is an event?
        * Something that happens in time, an occurrence; can be physical or in game/program. 
    * What is an event handler?
        * Something that listens for events and tells the computer what to do when these events occur.
    * Can you identify events and the actions they trigger that you experience daily with your personal technology?

### 2. Introduce Variables (5 minutes)

* Define Variables.
* Discuss variable Names, Values and Data Types.
* Allow students to experiment with setting variable values and changing the values to different data types in MakeCode Arcade

### 3. Sprites as Variables (5 minutes)

* Explain that Sprites are an Object data type of variable.
* Discuss the variety of properties (or data types) a Sprite can have.
* Allow students to experiment with setting different Sprite data type properties and behaviors.
* Remind students of how they have used Sprites before today.

### 4. Create a story (25 minutes) 

* Introduce the students to their next task:
    * Students will use sprites to tell a story.
    * They must create at least two sprites in their story.
    * Sprites must have dialog that has at least 9 statements between the sprites.
        * Ex: 3 sprites could each say three statements.
    * Students can create an original story, tell a joke, introduce themselves and talk about their hobbies/interest, or retell a scene from an existing novel, book, TV show, comic book, fable.
* Give students five minutes to brainstorm and plan their story.
* Encourage students to comment their code while they work.
* Give students 15 minutes work on their story.
* At the 15 minute mark, tell students they have 5 more minutes to work and then they will share what they have so far with a classmate.
* Give students another five minutes.
* Be sure to remind students to create a link to their program using the Share button.

### 5. Pair and Share (10 minutes)

* Have students save/share their code with you and/or with their classmates.
* Create a Link to their program using the Share button.

### 6. Reflection/Homework

(If you run out of time, you may also assign this as individual homework.)  
_Students should complete their reflection in their OneNote._

* How is your story developing?
* Did your partner's feedback change your view of your story plan? If so, how?
* Are there any challenges you need to resolve?
* What are you proud of from your work today?
* Do you need to work this evening to finish the project in time for sharing tomorrow?
