### Learning Objectives 

Computational Thinking Practice [5.E](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23).
* [IOC-2.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=130) Explain how computing resources can be protected and can be misused.
* [IOC-2.C](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) Explain how unauthorized access to computing resources is gained.

### Essential Knowledge 

* IOC-2.B.1
* IOC-2.B.2
* IOC-2.B.3
* IOC-2.B.4
* [IOC-2.B.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=130) Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Decryption is the process of decoding the data. Two common encryption approaches are:
    * Symmetric key encryption involves one key for both encryption and decryption.
    * Public key encryption pairs a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender does not need the receiver's private key to encrypt a message, but the receiver's private key is required to decrypt the message.
* [IOC-2.B.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=130) Certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validate the ownership of encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model.
* [IOC-2.B.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) Computer virus and malware scanning software can help protect a computing system against infection.
* [IOC-2.B.8](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) A computer virus is a malicious program that can copy itself and gain access to a computer in an unauthorized way. Computer viruses often attach themselves to legitimate programs and start running independently on a computer.
* [IOC-2.B.9](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) Malware is a software intended to damage a computing system or to take partial control over its operation.
* [IOC-2.B.10](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) All real-world systems have errors or design flaw that can be exploited to compromise them. Regular software updates help fix errors that could compromise a computing system.
* [IOC-2.B.11](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) Users can control the permissions programs have for collecting user information. Users should review the permission settings of programs to protect their privacy.
* [IOC-2.C.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) Phishing is a technique that attempts to trick a user into providing personal information. That personal information can then be used to access sensitive online resources, such as bank accounts and emails.
* [IOC-2.C.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) Keylogging is the use of a program to record every keystroke made by a computer user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information.
* [IOC-2.C.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way that this can happen is through a rogue access point.
* [IOC-2.C.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) A rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks.
* [IOC-2.C.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) A malicious link can be disguised on a web page or in an email message.
* [IOC-2.C.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) Unsolicited emails, attachments, links, and forms in emails can be used to compromise the security of a computing system. These can come from unknown senders or from known senders whos security has been compromised.
* [IOC-2.C.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=131) Untrustworthy (often free) downloads from freeware or shareware sites can contain malware.

## Details

### 1. Encryption discussion (10 minutes)

* Break students into groups of 4-5.
* Ask them to discuss the questions regarding the pages they read from Chapter 5 last night.
* When students have finished discussing their answers, ask groups to share their answers to ensure everyone has the correct response.

### 2. Authentication measures (5 minutes)

* Define authentication  
* Explain three factors of authentication
* Explain multi-factor authentication

### 3. Hazards to your PII and computing devices (5 minutes)

* Explain what a hacker is:
    * Play the Hackers film trailer (you do not have to play the entire video).
* Explain how computing devices can be misused:
    * Malware
    * Computer viruses
    * Spyware
    * Worms
    * Trojan horses
    * Phishing schemes
    * Rogue access points

### 4. Protecting your computer (5 minutes)

* Play the Protect Your Computer from Malware | Federal Trade Commission video.
* Discuss any questions students have.

### 5. Group activity (25 minutes)

* Organize students in pairs. 
* You can use the Group Generator program to randomly sort students.
* Task them with creating a one-page visual that teaches others about protecting their PII and their computers from hackers.
* Explain that this is a mini-project that they should be able to complete in class, but if they need to, they can complete it for homework tonight. They will include:
    * Authentication measures.
    * Ways to protect their computer from viruses and malware.
* Students can use any program they want to create their one-pager.
* Encourage them to make it attractive and eye-catching.
* Show them a sample of a visual teaching children how to stay safe when talking to people online.
* Explain that the sample does not cover the topics of their one-pager, but it demonstrates one way they could present their information.
* Emphasize that their one-pager should answer the following questions:
    * What are authentication measures?
    * Why are they important?
    * Why is two-factor authentication recommended?
    * How can you protect your computer from viruses and malware?
    * What is a phishing scheme?
    * How do you avoid them?
* Encourage them to use the One-Pager Brainstorm-Planning Sheet to guide their work.
* Collect their finished products by the end of the class, or allow them to finish the one-pager for homework.

### 6. Homework 

* If student groups do not finish their one-page visual, they need to finish it for homework.
