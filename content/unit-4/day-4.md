## Overview

In Day 4, we will cover computing bias. Students will first reflect on bias that happens to them and to others. They will then learn what computing bias is and how it can impact a large cross-section of the community. They will learn about examples that are inaccessible and accessible to persons with disabilities. They will then learn how a lack of diversity in the computer science field contributes to bias and explore ways to increase diversity to lessen bias.

Day 4 will be about:

* Computing bias
* How computing bias occurs
* How companies can lessen diversity when they design
* How a lack of diversity in the computer science filed contributes to bias
* Ways to increase diversity
