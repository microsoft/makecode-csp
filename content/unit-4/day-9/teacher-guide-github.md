We will not be utilizing [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) or any of the other Education-focused products in this course. However, you are free to explore the offerings on your own.

GitHub Classroom in particular may be helpful for some educators to be able to create MakeCode Arcade programming assignments and manage student submissions - [Code in the browser with github classroom](https://github.blog/2020-05-26-code-in-the-browser-with-github-classroom/).
