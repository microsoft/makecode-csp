### Learning Objectives 

Computational Thinking Practice [5.E](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23).
* [IOC-2.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=130) Explain how computing resources can be protected and can be misused.

### Essential Knowledge 

* [IOC-2.B.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=130) Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Decryption is the process of decoding the data. Two common encryption approaches are:
    * Symmetric key encryption involves one key for both encryption and decryption.
    * Public key encryption pairs a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender does not need the receiver's private key to encrypt a message, but the receiver's private key is required to decrypt the message.

## Details

### 1. Cipher challenge (10 minutes)

* Ask students to use a Vigenère cipher to decode an encrypted message:
    * Display the secret message on the slide.
    * Ask student to decode it.
    * They can use the Cipher template as a blank table to help them decode the message.
    * Give them two hints:
        * It is a Vigenère cipher.
        * The key is a programming tool they use in class.
    * If after five minutes, students have attempted to discover the key to the cipher, but failed, you can provide them with the MakeCode cipher document so they have the key.
    * Then, give them the remaining time to decode the message.

### 2. History of cryptography and explanation of ciphers (15 minutes)

* Using the PowerPoint deck provided, explain:
    * What is the field of cryptography?
    * The history of cryptography
    * Caesar Cipher
    * Vigenère Cipher
    * Lessons for the Internet age

### 3. MakeCode Arcade programming activity (10 minutes)

* Using the PowerPoint deck provided, lead students through an example application of a Vigenère cipher used to encode/decode images in MakeCode Arcade.
* Program: [MakeCode.com](https://arcade.makecode.com/87951-72279-92245-16991)

### 4. Group discussion (15 minutes)

* Break students into groups of 4-5.
* You can use the [Group Generator program](https://arcade.makecode.com/31859-57060-41272-95490) to randomly sort students.
* Ask them to discuss the questions regarding the pages they read from Chapter 5 last night.
* When students have finished discussing their answers, ask groups to share their answers to ensure everyone has the correct response.

### 5. Homework

* Read pages 21-36 of Blown to Bits Chapter 5.
* Students should answer the questions on the <a href="/unit-4/day-7/homework">Homework: Blown to Bits Chapter 5 pages 21-36 Questions</a> page.
