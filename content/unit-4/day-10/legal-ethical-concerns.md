IOC-1.B
* [IOC-1.F](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=126) Explain how the use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns.
* IOC-2.A

### Essential Knowledge 

* IOC-1.B.1
* [IOC-1.F.8](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=127) As with any technology or medium, using computing to harm individuals or groups of people raises legal and ethical concerns. 
* [IOC-1.F.9](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=127) Computing can play a role in social and political issues, which in turn often raises legal and ethical concerns. 
* [IOC-1.F.11](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=127) Computing innovations can raise legal and ethical concerns. Some examples of these include: 
    * The development of software that allows access to digital medial downloads and streaming. 
    * The development of algorithms that include bias. 
    * The existence of computing devices that collect and analyze data by continuously monitoring activities.
