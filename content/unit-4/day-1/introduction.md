### Essential Knowledge

* [IOC-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) People create computing innovations.
* [IOC-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations. 
* [IOC-1.A.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance. 
* [IOC-1.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person.
