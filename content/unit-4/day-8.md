## Overview

In Day 8, we will finish their discussion of Chapter 5 from _Blown to Bits_. Students will then learn about authentication measures to verify the identity of the user. They will then learn how hackers can steal their PII and harm their computing devices by using malware, phishing schemes, and rogue access points. Students then learn how to protect their computing devices and PII. Student groups will create a one-page visual that teaches others about staying safe online.

Day 8 will be about:

* Public key encryption
* Digital signatures and certificates
* Authentication
* Two-factor authentication
* Malware
