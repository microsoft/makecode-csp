## Overview

On Day 16, students debrief everything they have learned in this unit and through the debates to further synthesize the concept that computing innovations can be both beneficial and harmful and that computing innovations can have an impact beyond its intended purpose. Students will then present their impact of computing findings for their next chosen innovation. When presentations are finished, the class will vote on the most important or noteworthy example of the day.

Day 16 will be about:

* Beneficial and harmful effects of computing innovations.
* The unintended consequences of computing innovations.
