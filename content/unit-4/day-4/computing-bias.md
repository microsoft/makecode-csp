### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments

1. Have You Ever? (15 minutes)
2. Computing Bias (10 minutes)
3. Lack of Diversity (20 minutes)
4. Robot Racism (Optional)
5. Homework

### Learning Objectives 

* Computational Thinking Practice [5.E](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23).
* [IOC-1.D](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=124) Explain how bias exists in computing innovations.
* CRD-1.A

### Essential Knowledge 

* [IOC-1.D.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=124) Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
* [IOC-1.D.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=124) Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.
* [IOC-1.D.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=124) Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development.
* CRD-1.A.3
* CRD-1.A.4
* CRD-1.A.5
* CRD-1.A.6

### 1. Have You Ever? (15 minutes)

* Ask students to stand up and arrange themselves in a straight line in the middle of the classroom. 
* Explain to students that you will ask one question at a time: 
    * If their answer to the question is yes, move to the left of the room. 
    * If their answer to the question is no, move to the right of the room. 
* Prepare students that the questions are thoughtful and may make them feel uncomfortable. 
* When finished asking each question, ask students to quietly reflect on what they felt/observed during the activity and to write their responses on the <a href="/unit-4/day-4/have-you-ever-reflection">Have You Ever? Reflection</a> page. 
* Conduct a group discussion about their observations.

### 2. Computing Bias (10 minutes) 

* Explain what computing bias is. 
* Share an example of an inaccessible software for the blind. 
* Share an example of new design of game controller to be accessible: 
    * Play Xbox Adaptive Controller video. 
    * Ask students: How do you think the designers developed their modifications? 

### 3. Lack of Diversity (20 minutes)

* Explain one cause of bias is a lack of diversity in the computer science field.
* Ask students to read <a href="/unit-4/day-4/bias-in-technology">Bias in Technology Article</a>.
* Encourage students to brainstorm ideas of how to increase diversity while they wait for classmates to finish reading.
* Once everyone is finished, ask students to share ideas on how tech companies can increase diversity.

### 4. Robot Racism (Optional)

* If students finish their discussion about how to increase diversity early, ask students to read the <a href="/unit-4/day-4/robot-racism">Robot racism? Yes, says a study showing humans' biases extend to robots - CNN</a> article.
* When they are finished, ask them to answer the following questions:
    * Do you think a lack of diversity influences robot color?
    * How do we change perceptions that influence our biases?

### 5. Homework

* Read pages 36-47 of _Blown to Bits_ Chapter 2.
* Use Notetaking template to take notes.
