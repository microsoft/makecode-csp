Unit 4 is about the Impact of Computing and covers concepts related to Topic 5.1 (Beneficial and Harmful Effects), Topic 5.2 (Digital Divide), Topic 5.3 (Computing Bias), Topic 5.4 (Crowdsourcing), Topic 5.5 (Legal and Ethical Concerns), and Topic 5.6 (Safe Computing) Topic Questions. Here is a guide as to when you can plan to include formative assessment questions on these topics in Unit 4:

* You can assign the 5.4 Crowdsourcing questions anytime after Day 2.
* You can assign the 5.2 Digital Divide questions anytime after Day 3.
* You can assign the 5.3 Computing Bias questions anytime after Day 5.
* You can assign the 5.6 Safe Computing questions anytime after Day 8.
* You can assign the 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns questions anytime after Day 11.
* You can assign the 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects questions anytime after Day 11.

There are a variety of ways you can assign the questions to students. Options include:

1. Select one question a day as a bell ringer.
2. Assign questions without a blue shield for homework.
3. Create a quiz of all the relevant questions and designate a specific day for students to complete the formative assessment quiz.
