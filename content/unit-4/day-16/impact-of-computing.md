* [IOC-1.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Explain how a computing innovation can have an impact beyond its intended purpose.
* Computational Thinking Practice [5.C](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=23) Describe the impact of a computing innovation.

### Essential Knowledge

* [IOC-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) People create computing innovations.
* [IOC-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations.
* [IOC-1.A.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance.
* [IOC-1.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person.
* [IOC-1.A.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.
* [IOC-1.B.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended:
* The World Wide Web was originally intended for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community.
* Targeted advertising is used to help businesses, but it can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels.
* Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals.
* [IOC-1.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture.
* [IOC-1.B.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses.
* [IOC-1.B.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used. 
* [IOC-1.B.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Computing innovations have often had unintended beneficial effects by leading to advances in other fields.
* [IOC-1.B.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer.

## Details

### 1. Debrief lessons learned in the unit and through the debates (30 minutes)

* Discuss the essential questions for this unit with the goal of reinforcing the essential knowledge AP CSP students must have regarding the impact of computing innovations.
* Ask students to share their thoughts on "How are computing innovations beneficial and harmful?"
    * Answers will vary; key concepts to ensure students understand:
        * A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful based on a personâ€™s perspective.
        * What benefits one person may not benefit all (ex: remote learning).
* Ask students to share their thoughts on "Are innovators responsible for harmful effects of their computing innovations, even if those effects were unintentional?"
    * Answers will vary; key concepts to ensure students understand:
        * Programmers have a responsibility to consider the impact of their innovations on society.
        * As students progress in their careers, they need to be mindful of the decisions they make when designing programs and innovations.
* Ask students to share their thoughts on "What data are generated from smart phones, and what are they being used for?"
    * Answers will vary; key concepts to ensure students understand:
    * There are privacy risks involved in collecting and storing data on a computing system.
    * Privacy assures that personal information are collected, processed, protected, and destroyed legally and fairly.
    * Security controls access to personal information and protects against its unauthorized use and acquisition.
* Task students with working with a partner to analyzing the computing innovations they have presented so far, including the one they plan to present today, to identify data privacy, security, and storage concerns for each computing innovation.

### 2. Impact of computing share (15 minutes)

* Ask students to share the selection for this week and why they selected it.
* Encourage students to discuss the positive, negative, and unintended consequences of the computing innovation.
* Ask students to also share the privacy, security, and storage concerns with the computing innovation that they present today.

### 3. Voting (5 minutes)

* When everyone is finished sharing their selection, ask the students to vote on which computing innovation is the most important or noteworthy.
* To collect votes, you can use a Forms survey or other electronic polling program, or simply have students nominate innovations and vote by raising their hands.
