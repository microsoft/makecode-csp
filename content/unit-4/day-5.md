## Overview

In Day 5, we will learn about artificial intelligence (AI) and discuss how bias exists in AI algorithms. They will also learn about three kinds of biases found in artificial intelligence datasets. Students will learn about the danger of predictive algorithms in criminal justice. They will then examine ways programmers can reduce interaction, latent, and selection bias in algorithms.

Day 5 will be about:

* Artificial intelligence (AI).
* Computing Bias in AI.
* Three kinds of bias found in AI datasets.
* The dangers of predictive algorithms in criminal justice.
* Ways programmers can take action to reduce bias in algorithm.
