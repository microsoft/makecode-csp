## Student 2 – Yellow Tag

I have a challenge for you. You must collect information about one of your classmates without them knowing. The students with the blue tag are completing a questionnaire. You are tasked with working with another student with a yellow tag to get information from a blue tag student’s page **without the student knowing**. Find a partner and decide (quietly) as a team how you will try to get the information. You need to work quickly, however, because they will not be working for very long. **If you are caught, you lose the game**.
