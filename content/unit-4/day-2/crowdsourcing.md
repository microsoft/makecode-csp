* IOC-1.A
* IOC-1.B
* [IOC-1.E](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=125) Explain how people participate in problem-solving processes at scale.

### Essential Knowledge 

* IOC-1.A.1
* IOC-1.A.2
* IOC-1.A.3
* IOC-1.A.4
* IOC-1.A.5
* IOC-1.B.1
* IOC-1.B.2
* IOC-1.B.3
* IOC-1.B.4
* IOC-1.B.5
* IOC-1.B.6
* [IOC-1.E.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=125) Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
IOC-1.E.2 Science has been affected by using distributed and "citizen science" to solve scientific problems.
* [IOC-1.E.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=125) Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists; who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.
* [IOC-1.E.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=125) Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet. 
* [IOC-1.E.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=125) Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.
* [IOC-1.E.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=125) Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.
* IOC-2.B.9
* CSN-2.A.3
* CSN-2.B.3
* CSN-2.B.4

## Details

### 1. Introduction to Crowdsourcing (10 minutes)

* Define crowdsourcing.
* Ask students to read <a href="/unit-4/day-2/scientist-in-us-all">The Scientist in Us All</a> (or read it out loud as a class).
* Discuss key concepts in the article about Crowdsourcing:
    * What are the benefits?
    * How is this different than the Folding at Home program we learned about when we discussed parallel and distributed computing? How is it similar?

### 2. Group Activity (10 minutes)

* Divide students into four groups.
* You can use the [Group Generator](https://arcade.makecode.com/31859-57060-41272-95490) program to randomly sort students.
* Assign each group on of the four cutting edge scientific puzzles:
    * [Fold It](https://fold.it/)
    * [Eterna Game](https://eternagame.org/)
    * [Phylo](https://phylo.cs.mcgill.ca/)
    * [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/)
* Give students time to review the site as a team.
* Task them with taking notes on what the puzzle(s) are trying to solve and be ready to share with the other groups.

### 3. Share (10 minutes)

Each group shares:
What scientific puzzle(s) the site they researched is trying to solve?
How are they trying to solve it through crowdsourcing?

### 4. Bitcoin Mining (10 minutes)

*Define Bitcoin. 
* Explain the hazards of Bitcoin Mining. 
* Ask students to discuss the following questions: 
* What is the positive intention of Bitcoin? 
* What are the negative consequences of Bitcoin mining?

### 5. Homework 

* Students can start their homework.
* Read pages 15-26 of Chapter 2 _Blown to Bits_.
* Stop at "Because You Can't Live Any Other Way."
* Use the Notetaking template to take notes.
