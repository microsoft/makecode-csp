### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments

1. Computing human biases with AI (10 minutes)
2. What is AI? (10 minutes)
3. Biased Algorithms (15 minutes)
4. Group Brainstorm/Discussion (15 minutes)
5. Homework

### Learning Objectives 

* Computational Thinking Practice [5.E](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=23).
* IOC-1.B
* [IOC-1.D](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=124) Explain how bias exists in computing innovations.
* IOC-1.F

### Essential Knowledge

* IOC-1.B.1
* [IOC-1.D.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=124) Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
* [IOC-1.D.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=124) Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.
* [IOC-1.D.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=124) Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development.
* IOC-1.F.11

## Details

### 1. Computing human biases with AI (10 minutes) 

* Play the video - [Computing human bias with AI technology](https://youtu.be/RyanJ2h-9-g).
* Ask students to discuss the findings in the video:
    * What surprised you?
    * What is the study's theory on how we transmit prejudice?
    * What does this mean for modifying behavior in the future?

### 2. What is AI? (10 minutes)

* If you feel your students need help understanding what AI is, play the video. 
* Discuss the key takeaways. 

### 3. Biased Algorithms (15 minutes)

* Ask students to read the <a href="/unit-4/day-5/biased-algorithms">Biased Algorithms article</a> article.
* Play the video - [Are Risk Assessment Algorithms Fair, or Racist?](https://youtu.be/Gi4YeRqfb24)

### 4. Group Brainstorm/Discussion (15 minutes)

* As a class, brainstorm the following topics one at a time (5 minutes each question):
    * How can programmers reduce interaction bias?
    * How can programmers reduce latent bias?
    * How can programmers reduce selection bias?
* Students can use sticky notes to post ideas on the wall, or write their ideas on the whiteboard.

### 5. Homework

Read pages 47-53 of Blown to Bits Chapter 2.
Use Notetaking template to take notes.
