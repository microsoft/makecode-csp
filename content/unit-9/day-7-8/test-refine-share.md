## Details

### 1. Test your game with a partner and receive feedback (20 minutes)

* Pair up with a partner
* Follow the Feedback Cycle to test each others' games and give/receive feedback 
* Remember to be respectful and keep your feedback constructive
* When giving feedback, think about these questions:
    * Does the game work as expected?  Are there bugs? Is it incomplete?
    * Does it tie into the SDG theme well?
    * Is it fun?
    * What could the game creator do to make it better?

### 2. Debug and Refine your game (25 minutes)

* Spend the rest of this class period to fixing your bugs, and implementing the feedback you heard from your peers

### 3. Homework: User Acceptance Testing

* For homework, I want you to share your game with people outside of this classroom.  Could be family, friends, or even better, people in your target audience
* Observe (don’t interfere) and see if they:
    * Know how to play (without explanations from you)
    * Understood how the game aligned with your SDG
    * Had fun
    * Would recommend the game to others
* And think about whether your game had desired impact on the SDG that you wanted

### 4. Plan for distribution/publication of your game (30 minutes)

* One of the most important parts of both the design thinking process and service learning is the sharing of your ideas
* How can your game reach the most people?
* Consider what kind of partnership you might want? i.e. local food bank
* What media or channels to spread awareness?  (social media campaign)
* Will you need to host a webpage that people can access?
* Will you distribute the app on an app store or via another source like MakeCode Forums?
* Consider some options for posting your game:
    * [MakeCode Forum](https://forum.makecode.com/)
    * [GitHub Pages](https://arcade.makecode.com/github/pages)
    * Share to Social Media
    * Embed into a web page or blog
    * Email share link
