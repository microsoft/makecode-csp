## Overview

Students will use these two days to test their prototypes and get feedback on their builds. They will then construct a plan for sharing the designs with a wider audience. It is possible that they designed their solution for people with whom they will not naturally come into contact. If that is the case, they may design a sharing plan that will not be instituted. If your students did make an app that they can publish for the intended group, have them work on that execution during the second day.

Days 7-8 will be about:

* Test the prototype they built.
* Debug the prototype.
* Plan for publication/sharing.

WE Framework components:

* Critical Thinking
* Organization
* Action Planning
