## Details

### 0. Before Class

* Create a [Flipgrid](https://info.flipgrid.com/) Topic for Reflection
* Create a shared place where students can paste the share links to their games

### 1. Reflection Journal & Flipgrid (20 minutes)

* Reflection Journal - answer the questions in the SDG Project Reflection journal
* Flipgrid Topic Video (optional) - create a Flipgrid video demonstrating your game and reflecting on it

### 2. Project Re-Vision (10 minutes)

* If you could do it all again...
    * What would you do differently?
    * What was one challenge you couldn't overcome?
    * What was the main barrier?
* Re-Vision Statement is your ultimate vision for your project now, and what you would need to succeed
* For example: My recycling game is designed to help people decide if their trash is recyclable or compostable. In order to make it more effective, I will need to develop deeper skills in complex conditionals and logic loops

### 3. Celebrate by playing each others' games (15 minutes)

* Post your final SDG games in a shared location
* Spend time playing each othersâ€™ games
* Give kudos!
