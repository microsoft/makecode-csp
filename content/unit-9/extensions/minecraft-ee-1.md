## Summary

The second extension requires the use of Minecraft: Education Edition. The app can be downloaded for free and the two Hour of Code lessons included here can both be accessed without an account. The 2019 lesson is focused on how to use AI for good.

A village is threatened by fire and needs you to code a solution! Meet your coding helper, the Minecraft Agent, then program the Agent to navigate the forest and collect data. This data will help the Agent predict where fires will occur. Then code the Agent to help prevent the spread of fire, save the village, and bring life back into the forest. Learn the basics of coding and explore a real-world example of artificialâ€¯intelligence (AI).
