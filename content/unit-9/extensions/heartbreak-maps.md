## Details

### 1. Introduction to Heartbreak activity (5 minutes) 

We've focused on one particular problem and solution during this unit. Clearly, there are many more problems requiring solutions in the world. It can be overwhelming to narrow our focus enough to help make a difference when faced with so many needs. To help us focus, we're going to create Heartbreak maps. These maps are a type of information organization, or thought-mapping, that can help focus you into action.

Why Heartbreak instead of something we're passionately excited about? It's a way of looking at the other side of the coin. We don’t always act if we are thinking of things that we love. But we are often spurred to action when we’re sad, upset, or angry.

Can you think of any recent examples of people being called to action because they were sad, upset, or angry? (March for Life, Climate Strike, Black Lives Matter - make sure to give examples from different perspectives and groups.)

### 2. Heartbreak Map (30 minutes)

You can use the attached PowerPoint to guide this session. Start by asking your students the following questions:

Ask yourself: What matters to you?

Post each question and pause to give time to think between each question:

What makes you happy?<br/>
What do you love?<br/>
What is the most fun you have ever had?<br/>
What memory is your favorite?<br/>
What things or objects are important to you?<br/>
Who is important to you?<br/>
What things in your heart are sad? Make you cry?<br/>
What secrets are in your heart?<br/>
What activities do you love?<br/>
Now... what breaks your heart about these things?<br/>

Provide your own example (or use the example below):

One of my favorite things to do is go for walks. I like to explore new places, or just take a walk to be outside when I've been inside all day. It doesn't really matter where I'm walking, just being outside is good.

Sounds wonderful, right? But what breaks my heart about this?

There's so often trash on the roads or sidewalks where I'm walking. There are plastic containers from restaurants or bags that people have thrown out. There's paper floating along the ground or things being eaten by the birds and rodents that live outside. I know a lot of this trash makes its way into the waterways – storm drains, rivers, and then eventually the ocean. In fact, there's a major problem with trash from the land travelling into the seas and harming the water and animals that live there.

So what do I do about it?

Sometimes I take gloves and a bag with me and pick up trash as I walk. But I also try to reduce the amount of rubbish that I make. I use reusable straws and cloth napkins. I have a water bottle I refill instead of using a new one each time. That sort of thing adds up over time even though it seems small. I feel like I'm making a difference.

Now... what matters to you? REALLY matters to you? And what breaks your heart about it? THIS is what will motivate you to ACT.

Here are some examples from Joy Kirr’s class, a middle school ELA teacher in IL. [Joy Kirr's Class](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirrclass/10156454116/in/album-72157636333106976/)

### 3. Have students create their own heartbreak map.

In the center of your map, write and/or draw the things that you are passionate about.

In the next/middle level or circle, write and/or draw what breaks your heart about these things.

In the final/outer level or circle, write and/or draw your ideas for the ways to resolve these heartbreaks.

Students might not know what to put in their final step, and that’s okay. That can be worked on together if they want help. If not, assure them that it’s something they can work towards throughout the year.

_*When students ask, “Is this right?” Tell them that as long as it includes things that break their heart, there is no right or wrong answer. It’s all very personal._

If you feel that your classroom has a very safe and caring community environment, you can ask students to share their Heartbreak maps. But be careful not to require this part of the activity as it may be too personal for students to share.

### 4. Reflection/Homework (20 minutes)

Students should complete their reflection in a journal or notebook.

What might be one small thing you can do today?

Students may want to read the [#WhatDoYouCareAbout European Footprints storybook](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/62974712/stories-for-a-sustainable-future) compiling specific actions young people have taken across countries in Europe.
