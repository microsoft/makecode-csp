## Summary

The first extension requires the use of Micro:bit boards. While the code activity can be completed in Makecode, it is more satisfying if students are able to create their physical tracker and take it with them. This first activity is tied to the WE pillar of Health and focused on personal health and well-being by teaching students how to code an activity picker on a Micro:bit to increase their movement habits. This activity is best completed individually.
