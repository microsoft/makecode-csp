## Overview

On day two, students will learn how games can further social good goals, and experience some ways in which games can help us conceptualize global problems or solutions. Specifically, they will explore in depth using Simulation as a way to tie into a Sustainable Development Goal. Note, this lesson could be extended to 2 days, if students want more time to design their simulation or explore the visualization data.

Day two will be about: 

* Connecting current events and causes with games as a medium.
* Using simulation and data visualization to make a difference or make a decision.

WE Framework components: 

* Information Literacy
