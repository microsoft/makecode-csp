### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments 

1. Using Games for Good (15 minutes)
2. Creating Simulations (20 minutes)
3. Exploring COVID data visualizations (10)
4. Homework

### Learning Objectives 

* Students will develop an understanding about how games can be used to further social good causes
* Students will create their own COVID social distancing simulation in MakeCode Arcade
* Students will also explore various data visualization websites to visualize local data and see how data visualization apps work

## Details

### 1. Games for Good (15 minutes)

* Introduce non-profit Games for Good
* Have student explore the different types of social good games listed on the site
* Lead a discussion about the types of games they saw and how those games tied into a social good theme

### 2. Creating Simulations (20 minutes)

* Review what simulations do
* Examine a simple simulation demonstrating the difference between social distancing and no social distancing for the COVID-19 virus
* Task students to create their own COVID simulation using MakeCode Arcade
    * Students can choose whether they create a program that simulates what happens when people do not distance, when they do social distance, or both
    * Students can work independently or with a partner
    * Students have quite a lot of flexibility and freedom in how they represent their simulation (does not have to adhere to the example given)

### 3. Exploring Data Visualizations (10 minutes)

* Discuss how data visualization helps people make decisions and tell stories
* Direct students to the [Exploring COVID Data Visualization Sites](/unit-9/day-2/exploring-covid-data-viz-sites) page and task them with completing the tasks and questions in Section A
* Discuss how data can be used to create simulations that policy makers can use to make decisions
* Direct students to the [Exploring COVID Data Visualization Sites](/unit-9/day-2/exploring-covid-data-viz-sites) page and task them with completing the tasks and questions in Section B

### 4. Homework

* Finish COVID simulation game
* Finish responding to the COVID Data Visualization questions
