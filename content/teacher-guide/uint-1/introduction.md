## Overview 

In Unit 1, students will establish a classroom community by creating group norms and beginning to get to know each other as peers. Students will receive introductory materials regarding what computer science is, the principles of computational thinking, what students can expect to learn in AP Computer Science Principles, and how they will be assessed throughout the course and in the AP Computer Science Principles exam. Students will then work together to complete a team challenge and establish teamwork principles for their future collaborative work. Additionally, as an ice breaker activity, students will create a sprite in MakeCode Arcade that represents who they are. The unit will end with the students creating their first games in MakeCode Arcade and comparing the differences and similarities of the games they create.

The questions students will explore in this unit include: 

* What is Computer Science? 
* What are the principles of Computational Thinking? 
* What is the Design Thinking process? 
* How can collaboration enhance your work? 
* How has working collaboratively with other students improved an overall project? 
* What are some ways you currently plan your work before starting a project? 
* How does an iterative design process enable programmers and designers to create computing innovations in the real world? 
* What are some ways you can collect additional feedback on your program to use for improvements? 
* How do computing innovations impact our lives? 
* What apps or programs have you stopped using because you didn't like the design of how you interacted with it? 

## Estimated Time

14 days (45-50 minute classes)<br/>
1 day optional Extension activity

## Computational Thinking Practices: 

Computational Solution Design    

* 1.A Investigate the situation, context, or task. 
* 1.B Determine and design an appropriate method or approach to achieve the purpose. 
* 1.C Explain how collaboration affects the development of a solution. 
* 1.D Evaluate solution options. 

## Big Ideas

[Big Idea 1: Creative Development (CRD)](#)

>When developing computing innovations, developers can use a formal, iterative design process or a less rigid process of experimentation. While using either approach, developers will encounter phases of investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, and testing. Additionally, collaboration is an important tool at any phase of development, because considering multiple perspectives allows for improvement of innovations.

## Enduring Understandings

[CRD-1](#) Incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed.

[CRD-2](#) Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.
