## Unit 1

### Description of project

Students work in pairs to complete a design thinking challenge in which they select a user, identify a problem they can solve with an app, program, or device, and then use the design thinking process to create a paper prototype for their design and receive feedback on their design and modify their product based on that feedback. After revisions, each team will present their prototype to the class.

The introduction to the project can be found at [Design Challenge - Discover, Ideate](#).

### Learning objectives

* [CRD-1.A](#) Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration.
* [CRD-1.B](#) Explain how computing innovations are developed by groups of people.
* [CRD-1.C](#) Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration.
* [CRD-2.E](*) Develop a program using a development process. 
* [CRD-2.F](#) Design a program and its user interface.

### Connection to enduring understanding

By working with a partner to create a paper prototype of a program, app, or device for a chosen user, the design thinking challenge project helps students understand how incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed. (**CRD-1**) Additionally, students are lead through the design thinking process to complete the project. By using the design thinking process, students learn how developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-tasking. (**CRD-2**)

## Unit 2

### Description of project

Students work in small groups to create a static webpage on a Computing Systems and Networks topic. Students present their webpages to the class, teaching each other core concepts related to Computing Systems and Networks.

The introduction to the project can be found at Teaching Tool - Computer Systems and Networks.

### Learning objectives

* [CSN-1.A](#) Explain how computing devices work together in a network.
* [CSN-1.B](#) Explain how the Internet works.
* [CSN-1.C](#) Explain how data are sent through the Internet via packets.
* [CSN-1.D](#) Describe the differences between the Internet and the World Wide Web.
* [CSN-1.E](#) For fault-tolerant systems, like the Internet:
    1. Describe the benefits of fault tolerance.
    2. Explain how a given system is fault-tolerant.
    3. Identify vulnerabilities to failure in a system.
* [CSN-2.A](#) For sequential, parallel, and distributed computing:
    1. Compare problem solutions.
    2. Determine the efficiency of solutions.
* [CSN-2.B](#) Describe benefits and challenges of parallel and distributed computing.
* [CRD-1.C](#) Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration.
* [CRD-2.E](#) Develop a program using a development process.

### Connection to enduring understanding

By working with a partner to create a static webpage on a Computing Systems and Networks topic, students think critically on how to teach concepts about computing systems and networks topics and demonstrate how computer systems and networks facilitate the transfer of data (**CSN-1**), and how parallel and distributed computing leverage multiple computers to more quickly solve complex problems or process large data sets. (**CSN-2**) Additionally, working in groups to create their webpage helps students understand how incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed. (**CRD-1**) Finally, when designing their webpages, students incorporate the design thinking process. Students, therefore, learn how developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-tasking. (**CRD-2**)
