## Unit 1

### Description of project

Students work in pairs to complete a design thinking challenge in which they select a user, identify a problem they can solve with an app, program, or device, and then use the design thinking process to create a paper prototype for their design and receive feedback on their design and modify their product based on that feedback. After revisions, each team will present their prototype to the class.

The introduction to the project can be found at [Design Challenge - Discover, Ideate](#).

### Learning objectives

* [CRD-1.A](#) Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration.
* [CRD-1.B](#) Explain how computing innovations are developed by groups of people.
* [CRD-1.C](#) Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration.
* [CRD-2.E](*) Develop a program using a development process. 
* [CRD-2.F](#) Design a program and its user interface.

(**CRD-2**)

(**AAP-2**) Students also learn how programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence. (**AAP-3**) Moreover, working in groups to create their program helps students understand how incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed. (**CRD-1**). Finally, as they work through the design processing creating their project, students learn how developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.

## Unit 6

### Description of project

Students complete a data research project in Unit 6. Students identify a question they want to research, create a survey to collect data, clean and analyze the data they collect through their survey, and then create a visual representation of the data in an infographic. Students then present their findings to the class.

The introduction to the project can be found at [What is Data Science?](#) and specifically on [Slide 12 on Unit 6 Day 2's PowerPoint](#). Students continue work on the project on Day 3 to learn about [Data Collection](#) and bias in surveys, on Day 4 to learn about [Data Ethics and Survey Creation](#), and on Day 5 for [Testing and Sharing Your Survey](#). Students then wait for their survey results. When they have collected all of their data, they pick back up with the project and apply what they learned about [Data Cleansing and Visualization](#) on Day 6 and then complete their findings by completing an [Infographic Project](#).
