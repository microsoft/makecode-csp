## Summary

### Materials

* [EMG PowerPoint](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AqsgsTyHBmRBj2iKCvNUOb1vOMZ8?e=7mQQze)
* [Science Experiments 05 EMG Sensor](https://youtu.be/vxlPQZIwYRc)
* Micro:bits
* Alligator clips
* Aluminum foil
* Tape

### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments

1. Create an EMG Sensor (15 minutes)
2. Evaluate Data (25 minutes)
3. Reflection (10 minutes)

### Learning Objectives

* [DAT 1-A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=53) Explain how data can be represented using bits.

### Essential Knowledge

* [DAT-1.A.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) The same sequence of bits may represent different types of data in different contexts.
* [DAT-1.A.8](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) Analog data have values that change smoothly, rather than in discrete intervals, over time. Some examples of analog data include pitch and volume of music, colors of a painting, or position of a sprinter during a race.
* [DAT-1.A.9](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) The use of digital data to approximate real-world analog data is an example of abstraction.

## Details

### 1. Create an EMG Sensor (15 minutes)

* Explain that analog data is not only sound and images.
* Explain that we can also measure analog data like electrical currents in muscle movements.
* Define what electromyography tests do.
* Play the video showing how to create an EMG sensor.
* Pause throughout the video to make sure students have completed each step.

### 2. Evaluate Data (25 minutes)

* Encourage students to examine what happens when they flex their muscle in different ways.
* Encourage students to try the EMG on different muscles.
* Encourage students to compare their data to others' data.

### 3. Reflection (10 minutes)

* Encourage students to share their observations.
* Ask students to apply what they have learned to think of other analog data that can be collected using computing devices.
