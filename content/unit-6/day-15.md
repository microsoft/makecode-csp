## Overview

In Day 15, we will cover data compression. Students will learn about data compression and the two types of data compression. They will learn about different type of lossless and lossy programs for images and explore the differences of those file types by creating an image and saving the image in the different file types. Students will then learn about text compression and run length encoding.

Day 15 will be about:  

* Why we need data compression
* What is data compression
* Lossless
* Lossy
* Image data compression
* Text data compression
