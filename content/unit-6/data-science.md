## Overview

In Unit 6, we will learn how computers handle data and how students can use data to solve problems. Students will learn about the data science process and practice this process by completing a research topic of their choosing, analyzing the data they collect through a survey, and creating an infographic capturing their findings. Additionally, students will learn how data are processed to learn something new. Students will also gain a deep understanding of how information is stored on a computer in binary and seamlessly translated into what is seen on the screen or heard through speakers.

The questions students will explore in this unit include:

* How can we use 1s and 0s to represent something complex like a video of the marching band playing a song?
* How can you predict the attendance at a school event using data gathered from social media?
* When is it more appropriate to use a computer to analyze data than to complete the analysis by hand?

## Estimated Time

16 days (45-50 minute classes) 

*You may choose to do Lesson Days 11 through 16 in Unit 6 as mini-lessons throughout the course. Additionally, students will need time to collect data before they can analyze it so project completion will not be immediate.

## Big Ideas

[Big Idea 2: Data (DAT)](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=50)

Data are central to computing innovations because they communicate initial conditions to programs and represent new knowledge. Computers consume data, transform data, and produce new data, allowing users to create new information or knowledge to solve problems through the interpretation of those data. Computers store data digitally, which means the data must be manipulated in order to be presented in a useful way to the user.

## Enduring Understandings

[DAT-1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=53) The way a computer represents data internally is different from the way the data are interpreted and displayed for the user. Programs are used to translate data into a representation more easily understood by people.
[DAT-2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=58) Programs can be used to process data, which allows users to discover information and create new knowledge.
