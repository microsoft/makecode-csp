### Learning Objectives

* [DAT-1.D](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=56) Compare data compression algorithms to determine which is best in a particular context.

### Essential Knowledge 

* [DAT-1.D.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=56) Data compression can reduce the size (number of bits) of transmitted or stored data.
* [DAT-1.D.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=56) Fewer bits does not necessarily mean less information.
* [DAT-1.D.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=56) The amount of size reduction from compression depends on both the amount of redundancy in the original data representation and the compression algorithm applied.
* [DAT-1.D.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=56) Lossless data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data.
* [DAT-1.D.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=56) Lossy data compression algorithms can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approximation of the original data.
* [DAT-1.D.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=57) Lossy data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted more than lossless compression algorithms.
* [DAT-1.D.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=57) In situations where quality or ability to reconstruct the original is maximally important, lossless compression algorithms are typically chosen.
* [DAT-1.D.8](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=57) In situations where minimizing data size or transmission time is maximally important, lossy compression algorithms are typically chosen.
