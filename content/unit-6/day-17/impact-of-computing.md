## Summary

### Materials

* [Day 17 PowerPoint deck]()
* [Impact of a Computing Innovation - Recurring Assignment]() (already handed out to students on Day 11 of Unit 1)
* [Data in Computing Innovations]() handout
* [Data in Computing Innovations]() handout in Word

### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments

1. Data Types and Data Collection (20 minutes)
2. Impact of Computing Share (25 minutes)
3. Voting (5 minutes)

### Learning Objectives 

* [IOC-1.A]() Explain how an effect of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful.
* [IOC-1.B]() Explain how a computing innovation can have an impact beyond its intended purpose.
Computational Thinking Practice [5.C]() Describe the impact of a computing innovation.

### Essential Knowledge 

* [IOC-1.A.1]() People create computing innovations.
* [IOC-1.A.2]() The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations.
* [IOC-1.A.3]() Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance.
* [IOC-1.A.4]() A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person.
* [IOC-1.A.5]() Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.
* [IOC-1.B.1]() Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended:
    * The World Wide Web was originally intended for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community.
    * Targeted advertising is used to help businesses, but it can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels.
    * Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals.
* [IOC-1.B.2]() Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture.
* [IOC-1.B.3]() Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses.
* [IOC-1.B.4]() It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used.
* [IOC-1.B.5]() Computing innovations have often had unintended beneficial effects by leading to advances in other fields.
* [IOC-1.B.6]() Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer.

## Details

### 1. Data types and data collection (20 minutes)

* Explain what data types are.
* Distinguish between data types and data collection devices.
* For each data type, lead students through the process of identifying one example of each data type and one example of a data collection device for that data type.
* Discuss what an IPOS Structure Chart is and demonstrate how it works by evaluating the different way data is used when you are writing a paper.
* Task students with analyzing the computing innovations they have presented to determine what data types are used in each. 
* Students will complete the Data in Computing Innovations page with a partner.
* Ask each group to share the analysis they did for two of their innovations.

### 2. Impact of computing share (25 minutes)

* Ask students to share the selection for this week and why they selected it.
* Encourage students to discuss the positive, negative, and unintended consequences of the computing innovation as well the data type, an example, and how it is used.

### 3. Voting (5 minutes)

* When everyone is finished sharing their selection, ask the students to vote on which computing innovation is the most important or noteworthy.
* To collect votes, you can use a Forms survey or other electronic polling program, or simply have students nominate innovations and vote by raising their hands.
