## Overview

In Day 5, students will create a share link and QR Code for their survey. They will then share their survey with a classmate who will take the survey and give feedback on it. Students will revise the survey based on the feedback they receive. Finally, students will draft an email and a flyer so they can distribute the survey to their potential respondents.

Day 5 will be about:

* Testing the survey
* Sharing the survey with others
