### Learning Objectives 

* [DAT-2.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Describe what information can be extracted from data.
* [DAT-2.C](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=59) Identify the challenges associated with processing data.

### Essential Knowledge 

* [DAT-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Information is the collection of facts and patterns extracted from data. 
* [DAT-2.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Data provide opportunities for identifying trends, make connections, and addressing problems. 
* [DAT-2-A.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Digitally processed data may show correlation between variables. A correlation found in data does not necessarily indicate that a causal relationship exists. Additional research is needed to understand the exact nature of the relationship. 
* [DAT-2.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Often, a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion. It may be necessary to combine data from a variety of sources to formulate a conclusion.
* DAT-2.C.1
* [DAT-2.C.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=59) Problems of bias are often created by the type or source of data being collected. Bias is not eliminated by simply collecting more data.

### 0. Before class  

* For the Select a Question activity:
    * You will need to prepare a "lottery" method for students to finalize their data research project question.
    * On slips of paper, write numbers for the number of students in your class.
    * Assign each student a number a slip of paper and select from those numbers to see who "wins".
    * Another option is to allow students who have the same question idea to work together as a pair.
* For the Bias in Survey Questions activity:
    * Print 10 copies of the <a href="/unit-6/day-3/bias-in-surveys-activity">Bias in Surveys Activity</a> page, or 
    * Add the <a href="/unit-6/day-3/bias-in-surveys-activity">Bias in Surveys Activity</a> page to the Collaboration page. 
    * Be prepared to assign each example of survey bias to one of the 10 groups that are formed when you reach this part of the lesson: 
        * You can write each example on a slip of paper to give the students, or 
        * You can simply walk around the room and tell each group a number 1-10.

### 1. Student reflection (5 minutes)

* Encourage students to reflect on topics considering the following: 
    * Who would you need to survey to help answer your questions? (teens, parents, etc.) 
    * How many people in that group could you get to complete your survey? 
    * Which topic interests you the most? 

### 2. Pair and share (5 minutes)

* Encourage students to talk to a classmate about their topics:
    * What are your possible topics?
    * Which one do you think you will choose?
        * If you are considering one of the questions on the Prompt Ideas page, what is your back up question? (consider that question in the remaining questions as well)
    * Why do you want to choose that one?
    * Who will you survey?
    * Do you think you will have any challenges collecting data?
* Give classmate feedback on what you think about your partner's topic.

### 3. Select a question (10 minutes)

* Call out numbers and have students share their research data question.
* Record their questions to keep track of topics.

### 4. Data collection methods (5 minutes)

* Define quantitative vs qualitative data.
* Discuss the various methods for collecting data.

### 5. Survey creation tips (15 minutes)

* Discuss the different types of survey questions.
* Bias in Surveys activity:
    * Students should work with the peers sitting closest to them.
    * Organize 10 groups.
    * Assign each group one of the 10 examples of survey bias.
    * Ask students to follow the directions on the <a href="/unit-6/day-3/bias-in-surveys-activity">Bias in Surveys Activity</a> page.
    * After a few minutes, ask each group to share what they learned about their example.
* Give students tips on creating a good survey.

### 6. Create survey questions (5 minutes)

* Students will begin crafting their survey questions in class.
* They will finish creating those questions for homework.
* Share the <a href="/unit-6/day-3/survey-rubric">Survey Rubric</a> with students so they know how you will grade their surveys.

### 7. Homework 

* Students will finish writing their survey questions for homework
* Students must have all questions crafted by tomorrow to move on to the next step.
    * They will put them in Microsoft Forms tomorrow
