### Learning Objectives

* [DAT-2.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Describe what information can be extracted from data.
* DAT-2.D
* DAT-2.E

### Essential Knowledge 

* [DAT-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Information is the collection of facts and patterns extracted from data. 
* [DAT-2.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Data provide opportunities for identifying trends, make connections, and addressing problems. 
* [DAT-2-A.3.](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Digitally processed data may show correlation between variables. A correlation found in data does not necessarily indicate that a causal relationship exists. Additional research is needed to understand the exact nature of the relationship.
* [DAT-2.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Often, a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion. It may be necessary to combine data from a variety of sources to formulate a conclusion.

## Details

### 0. Before class

* Create a section in the Collaboration Space of your Class OneNote notebook titled "GED VIZ Stories."
* Copy the <a href="/unit-6/day-1/tell-your-own-story">GED VIZ - Tell Your Own Story</a> page to the GED VIZ Stories section and duplicate it so that you have enough pages for each small group.
* Number the pages so when you assign the groups, they know which page number they will use.

### 1. Introduction to Data Analysis and Visualization (15 minutes)

* Define Data Analysis.
* Show students the GED Viz visual of the computer import/export data.
* Explain the trend we see with this data.
* Play the GED VIZ Tutorial video.
* Discuss the goal of GED VIZ.

### 2. A Tale of Economies (5 minutes)

* Discuss the Great Recession of 2008:
    * Play the video
    * Explain the global impact

### 3. Group activity: Analyze Impact of the Recession (10 minutes) 

* Ask students to use the <a href="/unit-6/day-1/tale-of-economies">A Tale of Economies Activity</a> page to guide their exploration of two different GED VIZ slide shows.
* Ask students to work in pairs to review the data for each slide show and answer the questions on the page.
* You can use the <a href="https://makecode.com/CohR5JHEihJL">Group Generator</a> program to randomly sort students.
* Give students five minutes to explore; if they finish before five minutes, you can move on to the next step.
* Discuss the data together:
    * What were your observations from looking at the data?
    * Why do you think oil trade bounced back the fastest?
    * Why do you think iron/steel was the slowest to recover?
    * Why do you think Greece, Latvia, and Iceland never fully recovered?

### 4. Group activity: Tell Your Own Story (15 minutes)

* Ask students to work with a teammate to do the following:
    * Go to the <a href="/unit-6/day-1/tell-your-own-story">GED VIZ - Tell Your Own Story</a> page.
    * Select a topic they will analyze with the GED VIZ tool:
        * Students can find topic ideas on the <a href="/unit-6/day-1/tell-your-own-story">GED VIZ - Tell Your Own Story</a> page.
    * Create a slide show for the data they are analyzing.
    * Write a short explanation of:
        * What the slide show depicts, and
        * What you believe the data is telling us.
* Ask students to add the link to their slide show and their analysis to a OneNote page in the collaboration space.
* Give students 15 minutes to complete the task.
* If students finish early, encourage students to look at other group's analysis for a couple of minutes.

### 5. Homework

* If a group does not finish the Tell Your Own Story activity, they need to finish it for homework.
