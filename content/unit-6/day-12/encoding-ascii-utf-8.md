### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments

1. Explain Encoding (5 minutes)
2. Explain ASCII (10 minutes)
3. Write your name in ASCII & Binary (10 minutes)
4. ASCII and Unicode Video (15 minutes)
5. UTF-8 Discussion (5 minutes)
6. Homework

### Learning Objectives

* [DAT 1-A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=53) Explain how data can be represented using bits.

### Essential Knowledge

* DAT-1.A.1
* DAT-1.A.2
* DAT-1.A.5
* [DAT-1.A.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=53) Bits are grouped to represent abstractions. These abstractions include, but are not limited to, numbers, characters, and color.
* [DAT-1.A.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) The same sequence of bits may represent different types of data in different contexts.

## Details

### 0. Before class 

* Cut the strips of secret messages from the ASCII Secret Messages document.
* Find something for students to pull the message from - hat, bowl, etc.

### 1.Explain encoding (5 minutes)

* Explain encoding is a code for "non-numbers".

### 2. Explain ASCII (10 minutes) 

* Explain the ASCII chart
* Convert Hi to ASCII and then to Binary

### 3. Write your name in ASCII and Binary (10 minutes) 

* Students use the ASCII chart to write their names in ASCII and binary.
* Students compose a secret message for another person in class.
* Use the text from char code block in MakeCode to develop an ASCII decoder.

### 4. ASCII and Unicode video (15 minutes) 

* Discuss progression to Unicode
* Play video

### 5. UTF-8 Discussion (5 minutes) 

* Discuss UTF-8
 
### 6. Homework

* Complete the ASCII Homework assignment

### 7. Challenge 

* Using your secret message decoder as starter code, create a decoder that will convert from ASCII to symbol or symbol to ASCII.
