### Learning Objectives 

* [DAT-1.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) Explain the consequences of using bits to represent data.
* [DAT-2.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=59) Describe what information can be extracted from metadata.
* AAP-2.C

### Essential Knowledge 

* [DAT-1.B.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) In many programming languages, integers are represented by a fixed number of bits, which limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations on those values. This limitation can result in overflow or other errors.
* [DAT-1.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) Other programming languages provide an abstraction through which the size of representable integers is limited only by the size of the computer's memory; this is the case for the language defined in the exam reference sheet.
* [DAT-1.B.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) In programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers limits the range and mathematical operations on these values; this limitation can result in round-off and other errors. Some real numbers are represented as approximations in computer storage.
* [DAT-2.B.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=59) Metadata are data about data. For example, the piece of data may be an image, while the metadata may include the data of creation or the file size of the image.
* [DAT-2.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=59) Changes and deletions made to metadata do not change the primary data.
* [DAT-2.B.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=59) Metadata are used for finding, organizing, and managing information.
* [DAT-2.B.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=59) Metadata can increase effective use of data or data sets by providing additional information.
* [DAT-2.B.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=59) Metadata allow data to be structured and organized.

## Details

### 1. Introduction to computer's limitations (10 minutes)

* Define Integers.
* Explain limitations of the computing environment:
    * Computer is limited by the number of bits it uses
    * 64 bit & 32 bit
* Define Non-integers.
* Explain floating point representation.
* Provide examples of integers represented with floating point.
* Provide examples of non-integers represented with non-floating point.
* Discuss how floating point is stored in bits.

## 2. MakeCode Arcade activities (10 minutes)

* Ask students to complete the activities on the [MakeCode Arcade Activities](/unit-6/day-16/makecode-arcade-precision-activities) page.

### 3. Debrief and real life example (10 minutes)

* Ask students:
    * What problems will approximation and overflow cause?
    * How can you fix it?
* Discuss the real life example:
    * Explain what happened with the Patriot missile failure in 1991.

### 4. Arithmetic operators and Numeric procedures (5 minutes)

* Discuss the Exam Reference Sheet related to arithmetic operators and numeric procedures. 
* Explain each scenario

### 4. Metadata discussion (10 minutes)

* Define metadata
* Webpage Metadata Activity:
    * Ask students to go to arcade.makecode.com
    * Inspect the metadata
    * Ask students: What examples of metadata do you see on the page?
* Define digital metadata
* Considerations regarding metadata:
    * Discuss thoughts on questions posed

### 5. Homework

* Respond to the following prompt:
    * _Consider a health app that tracks your physical activity, food intake, heartbeat, rest, etc. What should a company do with this information? What could they do with it?_
