### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments

1. Share GED VIZ "Stories" (10 minutes)
2. What is Data Science? (15 minutes)
3. Introduction to Data Research Project (20 minutes)
4. Homework

### Learning Objectives 

* [DAT-2.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Describe what information can be extracted from data.
* DAT-2.C
* DAT-2.D
* DAT-2.E

### Essential Knowledge 

* [DAT-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Information is the collection of facts and patterns extracted from data.
* [DAT-2.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Data provide opportunities for identifying trends, make connections, and addressing problems.
* [DAT-2-A.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Digitally processed data may show correlation between variables. A correlation found in data does not necessarily indicate that a causal relationship exists. Additional research is needed to understand the exact nature of the relationship.
* [DAT-2.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Often, a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion. It may be necessary to combine data from a variety of sources to formulate a conclusion.

## Details

### 0. Before class 

* Suggestion: Add specific days that students will complete each step of the project on the <a href="/unit-6/day-2/data-research-project">Data Research Project</a> page.

### 1. Share GED VIZ "Stories" (10 minutes)

* Ask students to share their stories.
* You can display their GED VIZ slides by selecting the link from their OneNote page.
* Discuss the following with students:
* Describe your process creating your GED VIZ stories:
* How did you interact with the program?
* Did you repeat the process, trying new scenarios?
* How do you think GED-VIZ benefitted data-driven journalism?
* What do you think they did to create the tool?
* Steps they took to gather the data?
* Once they had the data?
* Could it go beyond 2014? If so, how?

### 2. What is Data Science (15 minutes)

* Play the video: "What is Data Science?"
* Discuss the Data Science Process:
    * Planning
    * Data collection
    * Data cleansing
    * Data visualization
    * Action/Recommendations

### 3. Introduction to Data Research project (20 minutes)

* Discuss the data research project that students will complete. 
* Students will: 
    * Think about concepts you are curious about; things you want to know more about/understand better.
    * Identify topics that you could find the answer to by surveying others.
    * Select one of those topics to create a survey and collect data on the topic.
    * Analyze the data.
    * Create a visual representation of the data.
* Give students the <a href="/unit-6/day-2/data-science-process">Data Science Process Checklist</a> and the <a href="/unit-6/day-2/data-research-brainstorm">Data Research Brainstorm</a> pages to guide their work.
* Ask students to brainstorm ideas for questions they want to answer with a research project.
* Send students to the <a href="/unit-6/day-2/research-prompt-ideas">Research Prompt Ideas</a> page for ideas (or a choice).
* Everyone must have a different topic.

### 4. Homework 

* Brainstorm ideas of what topics you want to research by collecting data from other people with a survey.
* Have at least three topics you are interested in researching.
