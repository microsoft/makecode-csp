## Overview

In Day 16, we will cover how computer programmers use data. Students will learn about integers and non-integers and how they are represented in computers with floating point representation. Students will explore the limitations of computers and how those limitations can cause overflow and roundoff with a MakeCode Arcade activities. We will also review the arithmetic operators and numeric procedures in the Exam Reference Sheet. Additionally, students will learn about metadata - what it is, how it can be gathered, and the consequences of it.

Day 16 will be about:

* Computing limitations
* Integers and non-integers
* Floating point representation
* Arithmetic operators and numeric procedures
* Metadata
