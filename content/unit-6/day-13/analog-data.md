### Learning Objectives

* [DAT 1-A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=53) Explain how data can be represented using bits.

### Essential Knowledge

* [DAT-1.A.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=53) Bits are grouped to represent abstractions. These abstractions include, but are not limited to, numbers, characters, and color.
* [DAT-1.A.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) The same sequence of bits may represent different types of data in different contexts.
* [DAT-1.A.8](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) Analog data have values that change smoothly, rather than in discrete intervals, over time. Some examples of analog data include pitch and volume of music, colors of a painting, or position of a sprinter during a race.
* [DAT-1.A.9](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) The use of digital data to approximate real-world analog data is an example of abstraction.
* [DAT-1.A.10](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=54) Analog data can be closely approximated digitally using a sampling technique, which means measuring values of the analog signal at regular intervals called samples. The samples are measured to figure out the exact bits required to store each sample.
