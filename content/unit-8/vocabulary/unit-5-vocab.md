*All vocab from Unit 3 plus:

**Procedural abstraction** - provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does, not how it does it; allows a solution to a large problem to be based on the solutions of smaller subproblems

**Modularity** - the subdivision of a computer program into separate subprograms

**Function/Procedure** - a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values; also known as method or function

**Parameters** - input variables of a function/procedure

**Arguments** - specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called

**Array or List** - an ordered sequence of values

**Traversing** - traversing a list can be complete traversal, where all elements in the list are accessed, or a partial traversal, where only a portion of elements are accessed

**Linear search (sequential search) algorithms** - check each element of a list, in order, until the desired value is found or all elements in the list have been checked

**Binary search algorithms** - starts at the middle of a sorted data set of numbers and eliminates half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated

**Software library** - contains functions/procedures that may be used in creating new programs

**Application program interfaces (API)** - are specifications for how programs, functions or procedures behave and can be used by other software

**Simulation** - a representation that uses varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a phenomenon

**Problem** - a general description of a task that can (or cannot) be solved algorithmically

**Instance** - specific input of a problem (ex: sorting is a problem; sorting the list (2, 3, 1, 7) is an instance of the problem

**Decision problem** - problem with a yes/no answer (ex: is there a path from A to B?)

**Optimization problem** - problem with the goal of finding the "best" solution among many (ex: what is the shortest path from A to B?)

**Efficiency** - an estimation of the amount of computational resources used by an algorithm; typically expressed as a function of the size of the input

**Reasonable amount of time** - algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or slower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.)

**Unreasonable amount of time** - algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies

**Heuristic** - an approach to a problem that produces a solution that is not guaranteed to be optimal but may be used when techniques that are guaranteed to always find an optimal solution are impractical

**Decidable problem** - a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct output for all inputs (ex: "Is the number even?")

**Undecidable problem** - one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer
