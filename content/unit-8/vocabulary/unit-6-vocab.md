**Bit** - shorthand for binary digit

**Binary digit** - either 0 or 1

**Binary base** - uses only combinations of the digits zero and one

**Byte** - 8 bits

**Decimal base** - uses only combinations of the digits 0 - 9

**Abstraction** - the process of reducing complexity by focusing on the main idea; by hiding details irrelevant to the question at hand and bringing together related and useful details, it reduces complexity and allows one to focus on the idea

**Analog data** - values that change smoothly, rather than in discrete intervals, over time (ex: pitch and volume of music, colors of a painting, or the position of a sprinter during a race)

**Sampling technique** - measuring values of the analog signal at regular intervals called samples

**Samples** - measured to figure out the exact bits required to store each sample

**Data compression** - reduces the size (number of bits) of transmitted or stored data

**Lossless** - data compression algorithms that can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data

**Lossy** - data compression algorithms that can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approximation of the original data

**Information** - the collection of facts and patterns extracted from data

**Metadata** - data about data (ex: the date of creation or the file size of an image)

**Cleaning data** - a process that makes the data uniform without changing their meaning (e.g. replacing all equivalent abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the same word)

**Overflow error** - an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values
