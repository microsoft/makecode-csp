**Algorithm** - a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task

**Code statement** - a part of program code that expresses an action to be carried out

**Expression** - can consist of a value, a variable, an operator, or a procedure call that returns a value; expressions are evaluated to produce a single value

**Execute** - the process of running a computer software program, script, or command

**Behavior** - how a program functions during execution; often described by how a user interacts with it

**Program inputs** - data sent to a computer for processing by a program; it can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text

**Program outputs** - any data sent from a program to a device; can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text

**Event** - an occurrence; things that happen; usually associated with an action (i.e. mouse click, button pressed)

**Event handler** - a part of code that 'handles' or listens for a specific type of event; when that event occurs, the code inside the event handler is run

**Program documentation** - a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed

**Comments** - a form of program documentation written into the program that helps explain what the code is doing.  Comments in a program do not affect how a program runs

**Logic error** - a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly

**Syntax error** - a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed

**Run-time error** - a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program; programming languages define their own run-time errors

**Overflow error** - an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values

**Testing** - using defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes, in the development process

**Sequencing** - the application of each step of an algorithm in the order in which the code statements are given

**Selection** - determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false

**Nested conditional statements** - consist of conditional statements within conditional statements

**Iteration** - a repeating portion of an algorithm; iteration repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met

**Variable** - an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be an array/list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values

**Variable types** - some programming languages provide types to represent data. These types include numbers, Booleans, arrays/lists, and strings

**Element** - an individual value in an array/list that is assigned a unique index

**Index** - a common method for referencing the elements in a list or string using natural numbers

**String** - an ordered sequence of characters

**String concatenation** - joins together two or more strings end-to-end to make a new string

**Substring** - part of an existing string

**Boolean value** - a variable that is either true or false

**Data abstraction** - provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation; manages complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific details of the representation
