Thinking about your project and the work you have done the last three days, answer the following questions:

* What was the purpose of the project and what was your final product?
<br/><br/><br/>

* How did you make your topic understandable to your audience?
<br/><br/><br/>

* Evaluate how your team collaborated together. What recommendations would you make to improve the experience?
<br/><br/><br/>

* If you had the opportunity to re-do your project, what would you do differently?
