Each group will be assigned one of the IoT examples. Wait for me to tell you which example to review.

Once your group has your assignment, each member should read over the description of the example. When everyone is finished reading the description, you should discuss the following as team:

* What is the goal of the project?
* What is the embedded system/device being used?
* What types of sensors are used?
* How is artificial intelligence helping (if used)?
* What's next for the project?
