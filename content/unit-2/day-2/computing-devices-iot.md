### Learning Objectives

* [CSN-1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) Explain how computing devices work together in a network.

### Essential Knowledge 

* [CSN-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) A computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.
* [CSN-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose. 
* [CSN-1.A.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data. 
* [CSN-1.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) A computer network is a type of computing system. 
* [CSN-1.A.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a receiver) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver. 
* [CSN-1.A.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver. 

## Details

### 1. Writing Prompt (10 minutes)

* Display the question: How is the Internet like the US Post Office?
* Ask students to write a response to the question in their notebooks.
* If everyone finishes with time to spare, ask for volunteers to share their responses.

### 2. Computing Devices (5 minutes)

* Discuss the different types of computing devices:
    * Computers and tablets
    * Smart watches
    * Gaming systems 
    * Servers  
    * Routers 
    * Embedded systems 

### 3. The Internet of Things (25 minutes)

* Explain the Internet of Things. 
* Ask students to work in small groups to explore an IoT example:
    * You can use the Group Generator program to randomly sort students.
    * Students read article and discuss with group.
    * Share what they learned with the whole class.
* Discuss consequences of IoT:
    * Benefits and conveniences
    * Unintended consequences and hazards

### 4. Homework

If there is time, students can begin their homework in class.
Students will read the remaining pages of "The Internet as a System and Spirit" and answer the corresponding questions.
