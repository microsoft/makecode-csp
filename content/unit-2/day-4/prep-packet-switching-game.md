## Supplies Needed

* Two decks of cards
* Sticky notes
* Yarn or string
* Tape
* ID cards for each "player" (ID cards can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AqsgsTyHBmRBkGzGFyDg5EYdHHM4?e=w6OFO9))

## Before class do the following

1. rganize the room so your desks (or tables) can create paths.
2. With yarn or string, create defined paths for students (packets) to travel. Have at least three paths.
3. With one deck of cards: Sort cards by their number (2s, 3s, 4s, â€¦ Kings, Aces).
4. Depending on your class size, place 3-4 sets together (ex: put the Aces, 2s, 3s, and 4s in one stack; the 5s, 6s, 7s, and 8s in another stack; etc.).
    * If you have more than 14 students and need to have more than one Computer 1 and Computer 2, on each stack, place a sticky note on the stack and write either "email" or "webpage".
5. With the second deck of cards: shuffle them well, and then create stacks of 5-6 cards (depending on the number of students you plan to use as routers).
6. Cut out the ID cards for each player (see Word document above). If you have more than 14 students, and you plan to have multiple Computers, TCPs, and IPs, you will want to print more than one copy of each page. (Even if you have three or more Computers, TCPs, and IPs, you may want to limit the number of routers to twelve to simplify the traffic flow.)

## At the start of class

1. As students enter class, hand them an ID card and ask them to tape it to their shirt.
2. Once everyone is in the room, ask Computer 1 students to stand on one side of the desk path you have created, and the Computer 2 students to stand on the opposite side of the desk path.
3. Ask the Packet students to stand in front of Computer 1 students.
4. Then, place TCP 1 and IP 1 students in front of Computer 1 students, and TCP 2 and IP 2 students in front of Computer 2 students.
    * If you have more than one TCP 2, IP 2, and Computer 2 students, write "80" on the ID card for one set of Computer 2, TCP 2, and IP 2 students, and write "25" on the ID card for the other set of Computer 2, TCP 2, and IP 2 students, etc.
5. Give TCP 1 and IP 1 students sticky notes and a pencil or pen.
6. Position the Router students in different spots along the various paths between Computer 1 and Computer 2.
7. Give the Router students one of the stacks of cards from the shuffled set of cards (see number 4 in the Before class instructions).
8. Give Computer 1 students one of the stacks of cards from the cards that you have organized by numbers (see number 3 in the Before class instructions).
