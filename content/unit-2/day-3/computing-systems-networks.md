### Essential Knowledge

* [CSN-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose.
* [CSN-1.A.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.
* [CSN-1.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) A computer network is a type of computing system.
* [CSN-1.A.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a receiver) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver.
* [CSN-1.A.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver.
* [CSN-1.A.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=110) The bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.
* [CSN-1.A.8](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=110) Bandwidth is usually measured in bits per second.
