Unit 2 is about Computing Systems and Networks and covers concepts related to Topic 4.1 (The Internet), Topic 4.2 (Fault Tolerance), and Topic 4.3 (Parallel and Distributed Computing) Topic Questions. Here is a guide as to when you can plan to include formative assessment questions on these topics in Unit 2:

* You can assign the 4.1 The Internet questions (except the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web) anytime after Day 4.
* You can assign the 4.2 Fault Tolerance questions anytime after Day 5.
* You can assign the 4.3 Parallel and Distributed Computing anytime after Day 6.
* You can assign the 4.1 questions related to the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web anytime after Day 7.

There are a variety of ways you can assign the questions to students. Options include:

1. Select one question a day as a bell ringer.
2. Assign questions without a blue shield for homework.
3. Create a quiz of all the relevant questions and designate a specific day for students to complete the formative assessment quiz.
