### Materials

<a href="/unit-1/day-11/impact-computing-innovation">Impact of a Computing Innovation - Recurring Assignment</a> (already handed out to students on Day 11 of Unit 1)

### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments

1. Impact of Computing Share (40 minutes)
2. Voting (5 minutes)

### Learning Objectives 

* [IOC-1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Explain how an effect of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful.
* [IOC-1.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Explain how a computing innovation can have an impact beyond its intended purpose.
* Computational Thinking Practice [5.C](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=23) Describe the impact of a computing innovation.

### Essential Knowledge 

* [IOC-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) People create computing innovations.
* [IOC-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations.
* [IOC-1.A.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance.
* [IOC-1.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person.
* [IOC-1.A.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.
* [IOC-1.B.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended:
    * The World Wide Web was originally intended for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community.
    * Targeted advertising is used to help businesses, but it can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels.
    * Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals.
* [IOC-1.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture.
* [IOC-1.B.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses.
* [IOC-1.B.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used.
* [IOC-1.B.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Computing innovations have often had unintended beneficial effects by leading to advances in other fields.
* [IOC-1.B.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=122) Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer.

## Details

### 1. Impact of Computing Share (40 minutes)

* Ask students to share the selection for this week and why they selected it.
* Students should share:
    * The computing innovation they have chosen.
    * The purpose/function of the computing innovation.
    * Its impact on the world.
    * The beneficial effects of the innovation.
    * The harmful effects of the innovation.
    * Their thoughts on whether they the effects were intended or unintended consequences of the computing innovation.

### 2. Voting (5 minutes)

* When everyone is finished sharing their selection, ask the students to vote on which computing innovation is the most important or noteworthy.
* To collect votes, you can use a [Microsoft Forms](https://forms.office.com/) survey or other electronic polling program, or simply have students nominate innovations and vote by raising their hands.
