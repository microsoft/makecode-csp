## Overview

In Day 8, we will practice creating a static webpage on glitch.com. Students will pick a topic that interests them and use that topic to learn basic HTML design. Students will learn how to add an image, link to other pages, create ordered and unordered lists, and how to create tables. Students can then use what they learned to combine all of these elements to create an informative webpage about their topic.

Day 8 will be about how to:

* Create a static webpage
* Add an image
* Link to other pages
* Create an ordered list
* Create an unordered list
* Create a table
