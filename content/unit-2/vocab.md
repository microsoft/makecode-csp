**Computer servers** - a more powerful computer that "serves" other computers by providing some service or functionality; usually housed in a data center so lots of other "client" computers can access it.

**File server** - stores and manages files that can be accessed by other computers on a network.

**Web server** - responds to requests for webpages by other computers.

**Routers** - devices that help "route" network requests and help connect computers and send data packets.

**Embedded device** - a highly specialized device meant for a very specific purpose; usually embedded, or included within another object or as part of a larger system. 
Computing system - a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose.

**Computer network** - a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending and receiving data.

**Node** - any addressable device on a network.

**Network interface card** - allows a computer to join a network as a node; a node must have one to be able to join the network.

**Network switches** - central nodes that move messages to nodes in the same network.

**Network router** - connects two or separate networks.

**Network bandwidth** - maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.

**Data transfer rate** - the time it takes to transfer data from one device to another (measured in Mbps - megabits per second).

**Uploading** - sending data (purchasing something, saving files to the cloud, sending files, posting on social media).

**Downloading** - receiving data (browsing websites, reading email, watching movie/videos, listening to music, playing online games).

**Latency** - how long it takes data to travel between its source and its destination.

**IP Address** - an Internet Protocol address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network.

**Hostname** - unique identification for a specific computer on the Internet.

**Domain Name** - part of a hostname that identifies a specific organization or group; acts like a phonebook for the Internet.

**Cloud computing** - a network of remote servers (powerful computers) located around the world, usually in large, safe buildings called Data Centers.

**Packets** - packages/envelopes of information that contain chunks of data or metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet as well as for data reassembly.

**Protocols** - networking rules that packets follow in order to get to the destination in the right order.

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** - the first protocol that helps the computer break the messages into packets, create a header for each packet that identifies the data, and assigns a port to the message.

**Internet Protocol (IP)** - the next protocol that adds its own header, adding destination and sender's IP address to the packets, and deals with the routing of packets through interconnected networks to their destination.

**Packet routing** - routers direct the packets as they move between networks; they choose the fastest (or cheapest) route (which is not necessarily the shortest route); usually dynamic, meaning it is not specified in advance.

**Path** - sequence of directly connected computing devices; begins at sender and ends at receiver.

**Internet** - a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (non-proprietary) communication protocols).

**Fault tolerance** - a system that can support failures and still continue to function.

**Redundancy** - the inclusion of extra components that can be used to mitigate failure of a system if other components fail.

**DDoS** - stands for distributed denial of service; cyber attack on a specific server or network that attempts to disrupt normal operations or traffic for that server. The attack floods the server or network with a constant flood of traffic that makes it impossible for the server to withstand the influx of messages.

**Botnet** - group of bots used in a DDoS attack to overwhelm a site.

**Sequential computing** - a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time.

**Parallel computing** - a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations, some of which are performed simultaneously.

**Distributed computing** - a computational model in which multiple devices are used to run a program.

**HTTP** - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

**HTTPS** - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure

**URL** - Uniform Resource Locator

**HTML** - Hypertext Markup Language

**Webpage** - page with information that is written in HTML and is published on the WWW.

**Link** - connection between one page and another.

**Website** - collection of webpages on the same domain.

**Web browser** - Software that displays an HTML page; HTML tags guide the browser.
