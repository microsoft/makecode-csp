## Overview

In Day 3, students will review that they learned from the "The Internet as a System and Spirit" by sharing their answers to two questions: (1) What does "End to End" in the Internet mean? and (2) What is net neutrality and why is it important? Students will then learn about computing systems and computing networks. Students will then learn about bandwidth and latency and explore those concepts by looking at their Internet speed versus Internet speeds of others around the world and by running ping and tracert commands. Students will learn about IP addresses, how to find their IP address, and what it means. Finally, students will learn about cloud computing and identify ways in which they use it.

Day 3 will be about:

* Computing Systems
* Computer Networks
* Bandwidth
* Latency
* IP Addresses
* Domain Name Systems
* Cloud Computing
