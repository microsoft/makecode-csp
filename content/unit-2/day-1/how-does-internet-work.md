### Essential Knowledge 

* [CSN-1.B.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=110) The Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonproprietary) communication protocols.
* [CSN-1.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=110) Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an Internet-connected device.
* [CSN-1.B.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=110) A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.
* [CSN-1.B.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=110) The protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet.
* [CSN-1.B.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=110) Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance.
* [CSN-1.B.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=110) The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands.
* [CSN-1.B.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=110) The Internet was designed to be scalable.
* [CSN-1.C.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=111) Information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets.
* [CSN-1.C.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=111) Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly.
* [CSN-1.C.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=111) Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all.
* [CSN-1.C.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=111) IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet.
