### Essential Knowledge

* [CRD-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=39) A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function.
* [CRD-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=39) A computing innovation can be physical (e.g., self-driving car), nonphysical computing software (e.g., picture editing software), or a nonphysical computing concept (e.g., e-commerce).
* [CRD-1.A.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=39) Consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations.
* [CRD-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
* [CRD-2.B.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software.
* [CRD-2.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program.
* [CRD-2.G.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed.
* [CRD-2.G.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Programmers should document a program throughout its development.
* [CRD-2.I.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=46) A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed.
* [CSN-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=109) A computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.
* [CSN-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=109) A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose.
* [CSN-1.A.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=109) A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.
* [CSN-1.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=109) A computer network is a type of computing system.

## Details

### 1. Introduction- How do computers communicate with each other? (5 minutes)

* Discuss statistics regarding the use of devices on the Internet.
* Discuss that computing devices communicate via radio waves.
* Set students up to use the micro:bits and [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org).

### 2. How the micro:bit radio works (15 minutes)

* Play the video [Behind the MakeCode Hardware - Radio in micro:bit](https://youtu.be/Re3H2ISfQE8). 
* Pause at designated times to make sure students have completed the directions in the video before moving on to the next step:
    * Pause at 4:26 to make sure everyone is ready to go
    * Pause at 4:42 to make sure everyone has completed step 1
    * Pause at 4:49 to make sure everyone has completed step 2
    * Pause at 5:04 to make sure everyone has completed step 3
    * Pause at 5:13 to make sure everyone has completed step 4
    * Pause at 5:35 to make sure everyone has completed step 5
    * Pause at 5:44 to make sure everyone has completed step 6
* You can play the remainder of the video and then let students explore the program further by testing it and modifying it, or you can let students try the program and modify it for a few minutes before you finish playing the video.

### 3. Radio Games (25 minutes) 

* Instruct students to work with a partner.
* Go to [MakeCode for micro:bit Radio Games](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/radio-games).
* Select one of the games and follow the guide.
* Encourage students to add comments to their program to demonstrate their understanding of what their code is doing.
* Encourage students to save their code to their MakeCode folder.
* If they finish early, encourage students to:
    * Select another game, or
    * Create a new game (using the radio command)
    * Add comments to their code to explain what they have created and/or modified

### 4. Reflection (5 minutes)

* Ask students to answer the questions on the slide:
    * What kind of infrastructure is needed to allow computers to communicate with each other?
    * How is the micro:bit similar to MakeCode Arcade?
    * Did you modify the code?
    * If so, how did you modify the code to make something new?
    * Is modifying code to make something new plagiarism? Why or why not?
