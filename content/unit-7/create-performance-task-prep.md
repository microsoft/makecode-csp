Educators will use the following resources in both the Mock Create Performance Task and the actual Create Performance Task scheduled for Unit 7. The resources guide students through the process to complete the Create Performance Task for the exam. Students complete a Mock Create Performance Task any time after Unit 5 with guidance from the instructor. In the spring, the teacher can discuss the scoring guidelines and help students brainstorm an idea for their Create Performance Task, but they cannot help students with the program or the completion of the responses for the CPT.
