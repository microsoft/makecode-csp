- [ ] Answer the following (the prompts for 3a) (total of 150 words):

    1. Purpose of the program:
    2. Functionality of the program:
    3. Description of input shown in video:

### Row 2

- [ ] Screenshots of two program code segments:
    - [ ] One that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type).
    - Insert screenshot here:
    - [ ] One that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program's purpose.
    - Insert screenshot here:

### Row 2 and 3

- [ ] Answer the following (total of 200 words):
    - Identify the name of the list.
    - Describe what the data contained in the list represent in your program.
    - Explain how the selected list manage complexity in your program code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list.

### Row 4 and 5

- [ ] Screenshots of two program code segments:
    - [ ] One showing a student-developed procedure that:
        - [ ] Defines the procedure's name and return type (if necessary).
        - [ ] Contains and uses at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure.
        - [ ] Implements an algorithm that includes and executes:

        - (Note: This screenshot is used in 3c.i and reviewed by the grader as a procedure in row 4. This screenshot is also used in row 5, but the grader is looking at it as an algorithm in row 5.)

    - [ ] One showing where the student-developed procedure is being called.
        - Insert screenshot here

### Row 4 and 5 

- [ ] Answer the following (total of 200 words):
    - Describe in general what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. 
    - Explain in detailed steps how the algorithm implemented in the identified procedure works. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it. 

### Row 6 

- [ ] Answer the following (total of 200 words):
    - Call 1
    1. Describe a call to the procedure identified in written response Row 4 and 5. Include the argument passed for the call and the path evoked by the call.
    2. Describe what condition(s) in being tested by the call to the procedure.
    3. Identify the result of the call.
 
    - Call 2 

    1. Describe a call to the procedure identified in written response Row 4 and 5. Include the argument passed for the call and the path evoked by the call.
    2. Describe what condition(s) in being tested by the call to the procedure.
    3. Identify the result of the call.
