## Plan

### 0. Before coding

- [ ] Review the Scoring Guidelines for the Create Performance Task to understand the expectations.

- [ ] Brainstorm ideas for your Create Performance Task. Ask yourself the following questions:
    - What do you want to create?
    - What is the goal of your program?
        - Do you want to create a game? tell a story? help someone?
        - Do you want to create a piece of art?
        - If you have used more than one coding platform, which one will you use for your project? MakeCode Arcade or Minecraft?
        - What programming language will you use? Blockly? JavaScript? Python?
    - What part of your program will meet the requirement for sequencing?
    - What part of your program will meet the requirement for selection? 
    - What part of your program will meet the requirement for iteration? 
    - How will you manage complexity with a list? 

- [ ] Make a plan for your program:
    - [ ] Write pseudocode or draw a flowchart of what the program will do; make sure the program has:
        - [ ] Sequencing (ordered steps)
        - [ ] Selection (if, if else, else ifs, or switch case that responds to a condition)
        - [ ] Iteration (any kind of loop)
        - [ ] Processes a list (that manages complexity)


### 1. Program code 

In your student-developed program code, what will your instructions for input be from? (must be input from **one** of the following):

- [ ] The user (including user actions that trigger events)
- A device
- An online data stream
- A file

What type of **list** (or other **collection type**) will you use to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program's purpose? (You must have at least one.)

Important: The data abstraction must make the program easier to develop (alternatives would be more complex) or easier to maintain (future changes to the size of the list would otherwise require significant modifications to the program code).

What procedure will you create that contributes to the program's intended purpose, where you have defined:

* The procedure's name
* The return type (if necessary)
* One or more parameters

Important: Implementation of built-in or existing procedures or language structures, such as event handlers or main methods, are not considered student-developed.

- [ ] An algorithm that includes (1) sequencing, (2) selection, and (3) iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure.
- [ ] Calls to your student-developed procedure.
- [ ] Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and program functionality.
- [ ] One PDF file that contains all of your program code (including comments). Include comments or acknowledgments for any part of the submitted program code.

### 2. Video

Create a video that demonstrates the running of your program, including:

- [ ] Input to your program
- [ ] At least one aspect of the functionality of your program
- [ ] Output produced by your program

Make sure video is:

- [ ] No more than 1 minute
- [ ] No more than 30 MB in file size
- [ ] .mp4, .wmv, .avi, or .mov format

Video can also have typed captions to further your demonstraton.

### 3 Written responses

#### 3a

150 words for 3a.i - 3a.iii

#### 3a.i

Describe the overall purpose of the program:

#### 3a.ii

Describe what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video:

#### 3a.iii

Describe the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video.

#### 3b

Screenshots of two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a list (or other collection type) being used to manage complexity in your program + written responses.

#### 3b.i

Screenshot of the first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list.

#### 3b.ii

Screenshot of the second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling the program's purpose.

200 words for 3b.iii - 3b.v 

#### 3b.iii

Identify the name of the list being used in this response:

#### 3b.iv

Describe what the data contained in the list represent in your program:

#### 3b.v

Explain how the selected list manage complexity in your program code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list.

#### 3c

Screenshots of two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a student-developed procedure that implements an algorithm used in your program and a call of that procedure + written responses.

#### 3c.i

Screenshot of the first program code segment must be a student-developed procedure that:

- [ ] Defines the procedure's name and return type (if necessary).
- [ ] Contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect on the functionality of the procedure.
- [ ] Implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration.
