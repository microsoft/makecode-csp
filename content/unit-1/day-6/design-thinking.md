### Essential Knowledge

* [CRD-1.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=39) Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations.
* [CRD-1.A.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=40) Consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations.
* [CRD-1.A.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=40)Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives.
* [CRD-2.E.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature.
* [CRD-2.E.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) There are multiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program:
    * Investigating and reflecting
    * Designing
    * Prototyping
    * Testing

* [CRD-2.E.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.
* [CRD-2.E.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.
* [CRD-2.F.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements.
* [CRD-2.F.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.
* [CRD-2.F.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows:
    * Collecting data through surveys
    * User testing
    * Interviews
    * Direct observations
* [CRD-2.F.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide.
* [CRD-2.F.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) A program's specification defines the requirements for the program.
* [CRD-2.F.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.
* [CRD-2.F.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) The design phase of a program may include:
    * Brainstorming
    * Planning and storyboarding
    * Organizing the program into modules and functional components
    * Creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
    * Development of a testing strategy for the program
