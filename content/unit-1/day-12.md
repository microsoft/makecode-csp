Overview

On Day 12, students will create their own computing innovation. As covered earlier, students use computing innovations every day when they post to social media, create short music videos, access a public database, ask a smart speaker to play music, or use GPS for directions. A computing innovation is "an innovation that includes a computer or program as an integral part of its function, and can be physical (e.g., self-driving car), nonphysical computing software (e.g., picture editing software), or a nonphysical computing concept (e.g., e-commerce)".

Day 12 is all about creating our first computing innovation by getting started with the primary tool for the course, [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com).
