2. Teamwork Activity (20 mins)
3. Teamwork Debrief (15 mins)

### Learning Objectives

* [CRD-1.C](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=40) Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration.  

### Essential Knowledge

* [CRD-1.C.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=40) Effective collaboration teams practice interpersonal skills, including but not limited to:
    * Communication
    * Consensus building 
    * Conflict resolution
    * Negotiation

## Details 

### 1. Computational Thinking Recap (10 minutes)

* Solicit volunteers to share their homework with the class - stories, drawings, poem analysis.
* Optionally you can choose to share homework anonymously (or you can have students share their homework in a digital form where their peers can read/see them).
* Remind students of class ground-rules and respect for all (trusted environment for sharing).
* As students share their homework, see if others can guess where they see the qualities of Computational Thinking in the story/drawing/poem:
    * Decomposition
    * Pattern recognition
    * Abstraction
    * Algorithmic thinking

### 2. Teamwork Activity (20 minutes) 

* Use the <a href="/unit-1/day-5/spagetti-tower-challenge">Spaghetti Tower Challenge</a> directions to set up the activity.
* Divide the class up into groups of 3-5 students.
* You can use the Group Generator program to randomly sort students.
* Instruct students that they have 18 minutes to build the tallest tower possible that will support a marshmallow with the supplies provided.

### 3. Teamwork Debrief (15 minutes)

* Lead a discussion about how that group activity went.  (**5 minutes**) Use the following questions to guide the discussion:
    * Who was able to complete the challenge? How?
    * What were some of the problems you encountered?
    * Did you find one or two people doing most of the work?
    * Were lots of people talking all at once?
    * Were there differences of opinion? How did these get resolved?
    * Did everyone feel like they knew how to contribute value?
    * Did everyone feel valued and respected?
    * If you were to structure this activity again, how would you do it differently?

* As a class, come up with a list of Teamwork Principles that you will use to guide all group activities going forward. In their groups, give students five minutes to create principles that cover the following concepts (**5 minutes**):
    * Expectations:
        * What do you expect from your fellow team members?
        * How do you want them to behave and contribute to the work?
        * How prepared should they be and what should they do if they are struggling with concepts necessary to complete the project?
        * What type of attitude do you feel will foster the most productive working environment?
    * Participation:
        * Roles - should we assign different roles to team members?
        * How engaged do we need to be with the project?
        * How do we handle distractions?
    * Communication:
        * How will we listen to our peers?
        * Are there any bad ideas?
        * How will we handle situations when more than one person has an idea and wants to share?
        * How should interruptions be handled when someone is talking?
        * How will you talk to one another?
    * Decision making:
        * How will you arrive at decisions?
        * What if everyone does not agree with the group decision?
        * How will you resolve conflict?

* When the groups are finished, ask them to share out three items on their list. (**5 minutes**) Each group should offer new principles. Write their ideas on the whiteboard, or somewhere visible for students to see. When everyone has shared, ask the following:
    * Do you agree with the principles listed?
    * Do any items needs to be added?
    * Are there any redundancies?
    * Do any principles need revising for stronger language?

* Once the list has been finalized by the class, document this on a poster that you can hang somewhere in the classroom.
