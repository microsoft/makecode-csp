### Essential Knowledge

* [CRD-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression. 
* [CRD-2.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation.
* [CRD-1.C.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=40) Effective collaborative teams practice interpersonal skills, including but not limited to:
    * Communication
    * Consensus building
    * Conflict resolution
    * Negotiation
* [CRD-2.E.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature.
* [CRD-2.E.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) There are multiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: 
    * Investigating and reflecting
    * Designing
    * Prototyping
    * Testing 
* [CRD-2.E.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.
* [CRD-2.F.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements.
* [CRD-2.F.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.
* [CRD-2.F.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows:
    * Collecting data through surveys
    * User testing
    * Interviews
    * Direct observations
* [CRD-2.F.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44)) Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide.
* [CRD-2.F.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) A program's specification defines the requirements for the program.
* [CRD-2.F.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.
* [CRD-2.F.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) The design phase of a program may include:
    * Brainstorming
    * Planning and storyboarding
    * Organizing the program into modules and functional components
    * Creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
    * Development of a testing strategy for the program
* [IOC-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) People create computing innovations.
* [IOC-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations.
* [IOC-1.A.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance.
* [IOC-1.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person.
* [IOC-1.A.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.

## Details

### 1. Design Challenge Review (25 minutes)

* Each team will share their prototype with the class
* Debrief the Design Challenge Experience as a whole class discussion
    * What did students learn during the process?
    * How will it help for future projects?
    * What will they do differently next time?
    * What value did collaboration bring to the project?

### 2. Computing Innovation Video & Discussion (10 minutes)

* Play the video A Pop-Up Japanese Cafe With Robot Servers Remotely Controlled by People With Disabilities
* Discuss the video with the students:
    * What do you think?
    * How will this transform lives?

### 3. Computing Innovation Activity (20 minutes) 

* Define computing innovation
* Ask students to brainstorm a list at least 15 computing innovations  
    * Students should evaluate each product they think is a computing innovation in light of the questions in section A of the Computing Innovations Activity document 
    * Students should only write down products that fit the definition according to the questions.  
* Ask students to analyze three of the computing innovations they listed and do the following: 
    * Explain the purpose/function of the computing innovation 
    * Consider the three items from two different perspectives: 
        * How is the innovation beneficial? 
        * How is the innovation harmful?  
    * Students will enter their analysis in Section B of the Computing Innovations Activity document 
    * Encourage students to conduct research if they are struggling to find beneficial/harmful impacts 
* Ask students to reflect on whether designers of computing innovations have a responsibility for how it is used 

### 4. Homework

* Complete the Computing Innovations Activity document, if you did not finish it in class.
* Talk to your family and friends about your list of computing innovations. Ask them if they have any computing innovations that they would add to the list. If so, add them to your chart.
