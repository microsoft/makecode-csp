## Activity

### A. Brainstorm

Brainstorm a list of at least 15 computing innovations that you or someone you know uses. Before you include it on your list, evaluate it in light of the following questions:

* Does it include a program as an integral part of its function? (It must to qualify as a computing innovation.)
* Is it easy to describe what the program of the innovation does? (If you have a hard time identifying the program in it, or you cannot easily describe what the program does, it might not be a computing innovation.)
* Is it easy to classify the computing innovation as "physical," "non-physical computing software," or "non-physical computing concept?" (If it does not fall into one of these categories, it might not be a computing innovation.)
* Is the computing innovation a reality or is it still theoretical? (Computing innovations that exist and are used by the public can be easier to understand and describe.)

Add your list of computing innovations here:

### B. Computing Innovation Examples

Use at least three examples of computing innovations from Section A and analyze each one for its beneficial and harmful impact.  Explain who the end users are, and how this computing innovation can potentially benefit and harm them. Also list any links to online references. (Three samples are provided)

#### Example 1

**Technology**: Video conferencing tools

**Purpose / Function**:
* Solves the problem of staying connected to people who are far away and/or allowing people to collaborate on projects even though they cannot be in the same office.
* Allows employees; students; families to connect with one another via video

**How is it beneficial**:
* Promotes collaboration among teams that cannot be in the same office
* Allows grandparents who may be far away from their families to connect with their grandchildren and extended families on a regular basis.

**How it can be harmful**:
* It can make it hard for employees or students to separate work from home life.
* It can create a situation where people are expected to be available all the time and rarely have down time or uninterrupted family time.

#### Example 2

**Technology**: Video games

**Purpose / Function**:
* Solves the problem of entertainment
* Allows adults; teenagers; young kids to pursue interests through creative expression

**How is it beneficial**:
* Studies have shown that games can help improve visual processes, attention, and executive functioning.
* They can also help people improve in job-related skills, especially those that require hand-eye coordination or a strong working memory.

**How it can be harmful**:
* Young kids who may not have good self-control /regulation can get addicted to video games.

#### Example 3

**Technology**: Attendance app

**Purpose / Function**:
* Solves the problem of keeping track of attendance at a school
 
**How is it beneficial**:
* Keeps track of attendance quickly so teachers and administrators
* Promote safety and record keeping for schools

**How it can be harmful**:
* Interrupts the workflow of a teacher's class, taking away from classroom instruction 
* Report can be inaccurate if a teacher forgets to submit attendance, causing administrators unnecessary work
