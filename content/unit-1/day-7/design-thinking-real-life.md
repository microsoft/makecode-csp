### Learning Objectives

* [CRD-2.E](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) Develop a program using a development process.
* [CRD-2.F](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Design a program and its user interface.

### Essential Knowledge

* [CRD-2.E.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature.
* [CRD-2.E.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) There are multiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program:
    * Investigating and reflecting
    * Designing
    * Prototyping
    * Testing
* [CRD-2.E.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.
* [CRD-2.E.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.
* [CRD-2.F.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements.
* [CRD-2.F.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.
* [CRD-2.F.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows:
    * Collecting data through surveys
    * User testing
    * Interviews
    * Direct observations
* [CRD-2.F.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide.
* [CRD-2.F.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) A program's specification defines the requirements for the program.
* [CRD-2.F.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.
* [CRD-2.F.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) The design phase of a program may include:
    * Brainstorming 
    * Planning and storyboarding
    * Organizing the program into modules and functional components
    * Creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
    * Development of a testing strategy for the program

## Details

### 1. Design Thinking Process (15 minutes)

* Talk about each of the steps in the design thinking process:
    * Discover (Problem Definition and Empathy Building)
    * Ideation
    * Prototyping
    * Testing
    * Reflect and Refine
* Play video on Design Thinking is Creative Thinking

### 2. IDEO (10 minutes)

* Company Feature: IDEO - [IDEO.com](https://www.ideo.com)
    * Talk about IDEO as one of the early founders and promoters of the Design Thinking process; still very influential in this space.
    * Optional - play videos about IDEO.
    * If you have time, you can also encourage students to visit IDEO.com, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and explore the site to learn about some of IDEO's recent work.

### 3. Discussion (10 minutes)

* Ask students to articulate what they have learned about the design thinking process.
    * How can it help when designing products?
    * What does human-centered design mean?

### 4. Share (10 minutes)

* Ask students to share their perfect house design. Students will share:
    * Who was their client
    * What did they design
