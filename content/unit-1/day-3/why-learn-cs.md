### Learning Objectives

* [IOC-1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Explain how an effect of computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful.
* [CSN-1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=109) Explain how computing devices work together in a network.

### Essential Knowledge

* [IOC-1.A.4](#) A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person.
* [CSN-1.A.1](#) A computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.
* CSN-1.A.2 A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose.

## Details

### 1. The most powerful computer in the world (5 minutes)

* Discuss Summit supercomputer
* Discuss Quantum computing
* If you feel you have extra time, watch the Quantum computing video (in the notes of the PPT)

### 2. What is computer "Software"? (5 minutes)

* Define computer software
* Discuss the variety of examples

### 3. Elements of a Computing System (5 minutes)

* Discuss the elements of a computing system:
    * Software
    * Hardware
    * Network
    * Data

### 4. Why should we learn about Computer Science? (10 minutes)

* Lead students in a discussion about why we should learn about Computer Science.
* Use the following questions to guide the discussion:
    * Have you ever wondered how some technology works? Or tried to fix/setup a piece of technology? Tell us the story.
    * Has anyone ever asked you how some piece of technology works? Like your parents or grandparents? Tell us the story.
    * Did you ever have an idea for a new technology? Or wish that an app/game/device had some different features or could do something? Tell us the story.
    * Why do you think it's important for people to know about technology and how computers work? 
    * What kind of jobs/careers work with computers?

### 5. Good vs. Bad Technologies (15 minutes) 

* Students will work in small groups to complete the Good vs. Bad Technologies Activity.
* Students will explore and discuss technologies that they view are good and bad.

### 6. Homework 

* If there is time, students can start their homework.
* Students will read Jeanette Wing's Computational Thinking article.
* Encourage students to annotate the article as they read it.
* Encourage students to write down vocabulary words they are unfamiliar with.
