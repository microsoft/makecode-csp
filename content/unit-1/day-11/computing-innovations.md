### Instructional Activities and Classroom Assessments

1. Computing Innovations - Group Work (20 minutes)
2. Share Top Innovations (10 minutes)
3. Synthesize Purpose of Computing Innovations (5 minutes)
4. Seeing AI (5 minutes)
5. Introduction to Impact of Computing Recurring Assignment (5 minutes)

### Learning Objectives 

* [CRD-2.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) Describe the purpose of a computing innovation.
* [IOC-1.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Explain how an effect of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful.

### Essential Knowledge

* [CRD-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
* [CRD-2.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation.
* [IOC-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) People create computing innovations.
* [IOC-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations.
* [IOC-1.A.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance.
* [IOC-1.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person.
* [IOC-1.A.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=121) Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.

## Details

### 1. Computing Innovations - Collaborative Work (10 minutes) 

* Ask students to organize into groups of 3
* Once in groups, ask students to share their lists from their Computing Innovations activity with their teammates
* As a team, select the most important beneficial innovations from among your group

### 2. Share Top Innovations (10 minutes)

* Ask each group to share with the rest of the class which innovation they selected and why

### 3. Synthesize Purpose of Computing Innovations (5 minutes)

* Ask students questions regarding what they have observed through their research and discussion:
    * What is the purpose of computing innovations?
    * What common threads run through the computing innovations that we have discussed?
    * What purpose do they serve?
    * Why were they created?
    * How do they help people?
* The point of the discussion should be to help students reach the conclusion that computing innovations are created to solve problems or pursue interests through creative expression. CRD-2.A.1

### 4. Seeing AI (5 minutes)

* Watch video about Seeing AI
* Discuss the beneficial impact of the app
* Discuss the process designers would have used to develop the app (Review of design thinking principles students have learned)
* Share the AI for Accessibility site for students who may be interested in exploring it later

### 5. Introduction to Impact of Computing Recurring Assignment (5 minutes)

* Set the date for the first Impact of Computing recurring assignment.
* Explain the details of the Impact of Computing assignment that students will complete every other Friday.
* Tell students when the first report will be due.
* Share the Impact of Computing document with the students.
