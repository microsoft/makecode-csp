### Essential Knowledge

* CRD-1.B.1
* [CRD-1.C.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=40) Effective collaborative teams practice interpersonal skills, including but not limited to:
    * Communication
    * Consensus building
    * Conflict resolution
    * Negotiation
* [CRD-2.E.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature.

* [CRD-2.E.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) There are multiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: 
    * Investigating and reflecting
    * Designing
    * Prototyping
    * Testing
* [CRD-2.E.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.
* [CRD-2.E.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.
* [CRD-2.F.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements.
* [CRD-2.F.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=40) Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.
* [CRD-2.F.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows:
    * Collecting data through surveys
    * User testing
    * Interviews
    * Direct observations
* [CRD-2.F.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. 
* [CRD-2.F.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) A program's specification defines the requirements for the program. 
* [CRD-2.F.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.
* [CRD-2.F.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) The design phase of a program may include: 
    * Brainstorming
    * Planning and storyboarding
    * Organizing the program into modules and functional components
    * Creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
    * Development of a testing strategy for the program

## Details

### 1. Form pairs and select a design challenge (10 minutes)

* Organize groups as you choose â€“ allow them to select their partner, select partners randomly "out of a hat" or with another random selection process, or you can organize groups purposefully by matching students that you feel need to work together.
    * You can use the Group Generator program to randomly sort students.
* Have teams select their design challenge - display the list of challenges and let students select, or assign the challenges randomly by selecting them "out of a hat" or with another random selection process.

### 2. Discover Stage (10 minutes)

* Research your users' career and activities; make notes of:
    * Procedures or actions that they must complete.
    * Daily routines.
    * Anything noteworthy that would help you decide how you can help him/her.
* Define the problem you want to solve with your app, program, or device.

### 3. Ideation (20 minutes)

* Brainstorm every possible solution you can imagine.
* Focus on quantity rather than quality.
* Do not place judgment on your ideas; share any idea you have.
* Do not stop after five ideas because you think you have one that will work; generate as many ideas as possible.
* Explore ideas for all types of computing innovations - apps, programs, and devices.

### 4. Select one idea to prototype (5 minutes)

* Teams should look at all of their ideas and decide which idea they want to prototype.
* Teams also need to decide what type of computing innovation they will prototype - a device or program; if it is an app, for what type of device (e.g., apple watch, phone, laptop).
* If they are unable to finish before class ends, they need to finalize their decision for homework.
