# Tool: Brainstorm Ideas

## Rules for brainstorming

<Layout>
<div>

<hr/>

**Defer judgment**

There are no bad ideas at this point. There will be plenty of time
to judge ideas later.

**Encourage wild ideas**

It's the wild ideas that often create real innovation. It is always
easy to bring ideas down to earth later!

**Build on the ideas of others**

Think in terms of 'and' instead of 'but.' If you dislike an idea.
challenge yourself to build on it and make it better.

**Stay focused on the topic**

You will get better output if everyone is disciplined.

<hr/>

**Be Visual**

Try to engage the logical and the creative sides of the brain. A
quick sketch can help make your idea more understandable to
someone else.

**One conversation at a time**

Allow ideas to be heard and built upon.

**Go for quantity**

Set a big goal for number of ideas and surpass it! Remember
there is no need to make a lengthy case for your idea since no
one is judging. Ideas should flow quickly.
