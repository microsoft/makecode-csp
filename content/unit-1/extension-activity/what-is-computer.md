### Essential Knowledge

* [CRD-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=39) A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function.
* [CRD-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=39) A computing innovation can be physical (e.g., self-driving car), nonphysical computing software (e.g., picture editing software), or a nonphysical computing concept (e.g., e-commerce).
* [CRD-1.A.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=39) Consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations.
* [CRD-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
* [CRD-2.B.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software.
* [CRD-2.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=41) A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program.
* [CRD-2.G.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed.
* [CRD-2.G.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=45) Programmers should document a program throughout its development.
* [CRD-2.I.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=46) A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed.
* [CSN-1.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=109) A computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.
* [CSN-1.A.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=109) A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose.  
* [CSN-1.A.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=109) A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.
* [CSN-1.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=109) A computer network is a type of computing system.

## Details

### 1. What makes a computer, a computer? (10 minutes)

* Discuss the common components of all computers:
    * Input
    * Memory
    * Processor
    * Output
* Ask students to:
    * Partner up with a classmate.
    * Think about the things that we've observed as computers in our lives.
    * Can you identify the parts that make them computers?

### Introduction the micro:bit (5 minutes)

* Explain what the micro:bit is.
* Identify the different components on the micro:bit:
    * Input
    * Memory
    * Processor
    * Output
    * Power source
    * Bluetooth antenna and radio

### 3. MakeCode for micro:bit (10 minutes)

* Ask student to go to MakeCode for micro:bit.
* Instruct students to select the Flashing Heart tutorial.
* Either go through the tutorial together, or allow students to complete the tutorial on their own.
* When they are finished, show students how to make comments on their code.
* When they are finished, remind students to save their program.

### 4. JavaScript (5 minutes)

* Explain that there are multiple coding languages.
* Ask students to switch to JavaScript.
* Ask students questions about how the same coding elements are represented in different ways with JavaScript.

### 5. Pair Programming (15 minutes)

* Explain the concept of pair programming.
* Encourage students to pair up with someone and create a program for their micro:bit.

### 6. Reflection - if you run out of time, you may also assign this as individual homework

* Encourage students to discuss or write a reflection on the following questions:
    * How was the experience of working with the micro:bit?
    * Did you stick with the exact instructions of the tutorials?
    * Did you venture beyond?
    * How did pair programming work for you and your partner?
