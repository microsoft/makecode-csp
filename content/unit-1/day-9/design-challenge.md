### Essential Knowledge

* [CRD-1.C.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=40) Effective collaborative teams practice interpersonal skills, including but not limited to:
    * Communication
    * Consensus building
    * Conflict resolution
    * Negotiation
* [CRD-2.E.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature.
* [CRD-2.E.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) There are multiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: 
    * Investigating and reflecting
    * Designing
    * Prototyping
    * Testing
* [CRD-2.E.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.
* [CRD-2.E.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=43) A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.
* [CRD-2.F.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements.
* [CRD-2.F.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=40) Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.
* [CRD-2.F.3](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows:
    * Collecting data through surveys
    * User testing
    * Interviews
    * Direct observations
* [CRD-2.F.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. 
* [CRD-2.F.5](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) A program's specification defines the requirements for the program. 
* [CRD-2.F.6](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.
* [CRD-2.F.7](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=44) The design phase of a program may include: 
    * Brainstorming
    * Planning and storyboarding
    * Organizing the program into modules and functional components
    * Creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
    * Development of a testing strategy for the program

## Details

### 1. Prototyping (25-30 minutes)

* Ask students to share what they learned by watching the two videos about prototyping.
* Students will create a paper prototype of the app, program, or device.
* Students will use the size of paper that corresponds with the size of the device students are designing for.
* Concepts to consider:
    * What will your app look like?
    * How will your users interact with it?
    * Imagine every step your user will take to use the program.

### 2. Testing (10 minutes)

* Teams pair up with another team.
* The first team shares their prototype, letting the other team interact with it. 
* One team member answers questions and helps with the trial; the other team member takes notes about questions, observations, etc.
* Teams switch roles after five minutes and repeat the process with the other team's prototype.

### 3. Reflect and Refine (5 minutes)

* Teams will discuss their findings with each other.
* Students will make refinements to their prototypes.
* Students will need to determine if they need to complete their refinements for homework.

### 4. Homework

* Students will complete any necessary refinements for their prototype.
* Turn in the Design Challenge Guide worksheet.
* Answer the Design Challenge Reflection questions.
