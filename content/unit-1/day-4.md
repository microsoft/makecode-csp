## Overview

In Day 4, students will share what they learned after reading Jeannette Wing's Computational Thinking article for homework. Students will learn about Jeannette Wing and what she meant by advocating that students should be taught to think like a computer scientist. Students will then learn about the universal components of Computational Thinking and work together to complete some computational thinking challenges.

Day 4 will be about:

* Computational Thinking
    * Decomposition
    * Pattern recognition
    * Abstraction
    * Algorithmic thinking
