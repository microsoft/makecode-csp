### Learning Objectives

* [AAP-2.A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=75) Express an algorithm that uses sequencing without using a programming language.
* [AAP-3.B](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=94) Explain how the use of procedural abstraction manages complexity in a program.
* DAT-1.A
* DAT-2.A

### Essential Knowledge

* [DAT-2.A.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=58) Information is the collection of facts and patterns extracted from data.
* [AAP-2.A.4](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=75) Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration.
* [AAP-3.B.1](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=94) One common type of abstraction is procedural abstraction, which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does, not how it does it.  
* [AAP-3.B.2](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=94) Procedural abstraction allows a solution to a large problem to be based on the solutions of smaller subproblems. This is accomplished by creating procedures to solve each of the subproblems.

* DAT-2.A.1

## Details

### 1. What is Computational Thinking (10 minutes)

* Discuss the article students read for homework.
* Guide students' discussion with the following questions:
    * What is computational thinking?
    * What does computational thinking involve?
    * What real world examples are included in the article that help you understand what computational thinking is and what it is not?
    * What were some of the vocabulary words that you looked up?

### 2. Jeannette Wing (5 minutes)

* Discuss Jeannette Wing's background.
* Discuss what she meant by "think like a Computer Scientist."

### 3. Computational Thinking (15 minutes)

* Using the PPT and talking points, deliver a lecture on Computational Thinking.
* Discuss Universal Components:
    * Decomposition
    * Pattern recognition
    * Abstraction
    * Algorithmic thinking

### 4. Computational Thinking Challenges (15 minutes)

* Divide the class into groups of 3-5 students.
* Pass out 1 worksheet to each group to fill out.
* Encourage students to complete the challenges as a team.

### 5. Homework

* Three choices, pick one:
    1. Write a short science fiction story about a character who uses the four ideas of computational thinking to solve a problem or overcome a challenge.
    2. Draw a picture that somehow incorporates/represents the four ideas of computational thinking to you.
    3. Analyze a poem or song lyrics to identify where you see the four ideas of computational thinking at work.
* Remember, the four ideas of computational thinking are:
    * Decomposition - the ability to break a larger problem down into smaller parts.
    * Pattern recognition - being able to identify similarities within problems.
    * Abstraction - a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples.
    * Algorithmic thinking - when you develop a step-by-step process or rules to follow to solve a problem.
