Unit 1 is an introductory unit that provides students with an overview of the course and introduces them to concepts related to Topic 1.1 (Collaboration) and Topic 1.3 (Program Design and Development) Topic Questions. Here is a guide as to when you can plan to include formative assessment questions on these topics in Unit 1:

* You can assign the 1.1 Collaboration questions anytime after Day 5.
* You can assign the 1.3 Program Design and Development related to the benefits of an incremental and iterative development and best practices in program development anytime after Day 10.

There are a variety of ways you can assign the questions to students. Options include:

1. Select one question a day as a bell ringer.
2. Assign questions without a blue shield for homework.
3. Create a quiz of all the relevant questions and designate a specific day for students to complete the formative assessment quiz.
