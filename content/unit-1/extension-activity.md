## Overview

In this Extension Activity, students will learn the four basic components that all computers have in common:

* Input
* Memory
* Processor
* Output

They will identify these parts in computing devices they encounter everyday, and begin programming the micro:bit, a pocket-sized, codeable computer. Students can use micro:bits or they can use the simulator. Students will also practice pair programming.

This Extension Activity is all about learning what makes a computer a computer, and getting started with programming the micro:bit with MakeCode.

* Introduce the four components that all computers have in common.
* Introduce the micro:bit.
* Code using MakeCode for micro:bit.
* Students will practice pair programming.
* Reflect on the process of coding the micro:bit.
