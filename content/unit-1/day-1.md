## Overview

In Day 1, we will get to know each other and learn about classroom expectations. We will also learn about the scope and sequence for AP Computer Science Principles. We will also examine how students will be assessed during the course and the structure of the AP Computer Science Principles exam.

Day 1 is all about establishing a classroom community and setting the context for the rest of the course.   

* Introduce yourself and spend some time having the students introduce themselves - establish your classroom as a trusted environment for learning.
* Provide an overview of the course, including class expectations and course and exam components.
* Encourage students to sign up for AP Classroom.
