## Overview

In Day 8, students will practice the design thinking process by working in teams on a design challenge. They will select a challenge from the challenge list (or you can assign challenges to groups), and then they will move through the design thinking process. Specifically, students will define their problem, empathize with their user, and ideate possible solutions.

Day 8 will ask students to:

* Select their team
* Select their challenge
* Research their challenge so they can define the problem and empathize with their user
* Ideate possible solutions
